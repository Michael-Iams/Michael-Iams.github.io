Ijams , <br/></b></i>both grandsons of Thomas Plummer Ijams, 1901.<br/>I regret that I cannot attend the Reunion of the Ijams and Rodman families, which is soon to take place in Miller Park. I therefore address my cousin Louis E. Ijams to refer to some items as to some of our kinsfolk.<br/>Dear Cousin Louis:<br/>My acquaintance with both you and our grandfather Ijams, so far as well recollected began in the early part of Sept. 1844. I was then in my thirteenth year. My father and mother with their children, then six in number, the second of the flock being myself, had journeyed from Magnolia, Putnam County, Ill. to Muskingum County, Ohio, on a visit.<br/>Grandfather Ijams and Grandmother Elizabeth Ijams had visited us in our home in Oxbow Prairie, Ill. in 1835 but at the time first above mentioned I had only the shadow of recollection of their first visit having been too young at the time of their visit to remember it distinctly.<br/>In passing through Dayton, Urbana, Richmond, Delaware and Newark to your father's home near Gratiot in Muskingum County Ohio, in August and the three or four first days in Sept. 1844, we saw frequent evidences of the interest the people were taking in the election contest in which Clay and Frelinghusen were the Whig Nominees for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency in the opposition to the Polk and Dallas, the Democratic candidates. The grown men and the boys also manifested their concern. Here and there were poles to indicate preferences, hickory poles to signify adherence to the Democrat party, and others to show attachment to the Whig party.Our friends were generally of the staid old Whig party and earnest supporters of Henry Clay.<br/>Pausing a little while at the residence of your father and mother, on the North side of the National road, in the neighborhood of the Rodman settlement, we soon visited Grandfather and Grandmother Elizabeth Ijams.<br/>There had for a long time been near Asbury Chapel, on a leading road to Zanesville, the market town of the county seat of Muskingum County and that continued to be their home until they were gathered to their fathers.<br/>They lived in a neat and well built brick house, situated a short distance back from the road. The approach from which was by a walk having but a slight ascent. The house was built on the side of a hill sloping eastward and north eastward. The entrance to the basement and cellar was on a lower level from the side hill as it sloped eastward, and not specially observable from the walk up to the front of the house. The spring with the spring house in which milk and butter were kept cool was a little further down the road, and near there to north eastward from the house and lower that the basement of the dwelling.<br/>It was an excellent spring, and formed the head of a clear little stream that ran along through the meadow.<br/>Grandmother Ijams, Elizabeth, had her loom house and out door back oven. She was thoroughly capable of managing all house work and from time to time went on horseback to Zanesville to do marketing.<br/>The home and surrounding were very comfortable and pleasant. The orchard was excellent. It contained choice varieties of apples and peaches, as I well remember.<br/>Early in the present century, in 1806, I think it was, William Hamilton and Susan, his wife, removed from Monogalia County, Virginia, accompanied by some of their children and their families, and settled in the locality. My fathers mother [Rebecca Hamilton who married John E. Dent.] and Grandmother Elizabeth (so mentioned by her given name to distinguish her from our Grandmother Sarah, the former wife of Grandfather Ijams), were among the children who colonized to that part of Muskingum County., Ohio.<br/>The homestead of the parents, William and Susannah, his wife, was in the fall of 1844, that of their son Rev. Samuel Hamilton, a distinguished Methodist minister, whom I well remember seeing while I was upon the visit before mentioned, and whose manly and rugged appearance, one seeing him would not be likely to forget. Grandmother Hamilton had died early in that year. [Rebecca Hamilton]<br/>Grandfather Ijams was born in Maryland April 3, 1773. He died at his homestead in Ohio on Aug. 16, 1847, in his 75th year. He was twice married, first to Sarah Duvall of Maryland and secondly to Elizabeth Manly, nee Hamilton, widow of Rev. Robert Manly a pioneer Minister.<br/>There was by the first marriage of Grandfather Ijams, seven children, whose given names were Rebecca, Lewis, Harriet, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Comfort and Sarah all of whom reared families, and all of whom finally with their families moved to this state. [Illinois] By the second marriage of grandfather Ijams, the eldest Rebecca Ijams was twice married, first to James Beck, and secondly to John Sunderland.<br/>Mr. and Mrs. Sunderland came to Tazewell County, Illinois, at the early date and settled near Washington in the county.<br/>My Grandfather John Evans Dent, visited Ill., in 1829, and chose a location for himself and children, married and unmarried, in what was then considered a part of Tazewell County, but which early in 1831 became a part of the present Putnam County, Ill. To that neighborhood in which Grandfather Dent made his settlement, my father and mother (she being next to the youngest of my Grandfather Ijams children by his first wife) removed in the early part of the fall of 1831. My father having previously opened to some extent the farm to which they came.<br/>An older sister of my mothers named Elizabeth Ijams, the third daughter of my Grandfather Ijams, was married to the Rev. Zadok Hall, and they with their children, two in number, came with father and mother to Ill. in Sept. 1831. Uncle Zadok and Aunt Elizabeth chose the vicinity of Washington, Ill. for their home place. He was itinerate during his active work in the ministry, which continued for many years, but both were at their death living on their homestead in Tazewell County, Ill.<br/>One of my mother sisters, next older to myself, named Charlotte Ijams, was married to Isaac Springer. They with their family removed from Ohio to Ill. in the fall of 1834. And first settled in the vicinity of what is now Magnolia. My mothers youngest sister, Sarah, was married to Joseph Hall, a younger brother of Rev. Zadok Hall. Uncle Joseph and Aunt Sarah came to Ill. in 1835. I presume it was or it may have been early in 1836. I remember quite well that Uncle Joseph had quite a stock of goods, for a short interval, in one of the houses on fathers farm near our residence, which was about one and one half miles from Magnolia, to which later place, however, Uncle Joseph removed when it came to have a local habitation and name, which I think, was in 1836.<br/>Your father, Lewis Ijams, removed from his home in Muskingum County Ohio to McLean county, ILL. in 1851 as I remember.<br/>Two children of Grandfather Thomas P. Ijams and Elizabeth, his wife, namely, William Fletcher Ijams and Nancy Ann (Ijams) Coffman, were, if I remember rightly, the next to come to Ill. Uncle William came first, I believe, to Marshall county and thence removed to McLean county. I have not the exact date of either settlement.<br/>Aunt Anna was married to John Coffman and they, on their removal from Ohio, settled in Marshall County, Ill. near Rutland.<br/>Aunt Harriet Ijams, (second daughter of Grandfather Ijams) was married to Henry Woolf, and they with their children removed to Ill. about 1858 or 1859, and settled in Marshall County, a short distance from Wenona.<br/>We thus find that the eight children became residents of Ill.<br/>I should say of all of them that their citizenship was one that made for good wherever they went. trained to industry and strictest integrity combined with good deportment, they did their part well and worthily ornamented the good example which had been set for them by devout and pious parents.<br/>I do not know quite how it happened that Grandfather Ijams was so generally known by his first name without the addition of the middle initial. It may be that when he came into public life the middle initial happened to be dropped in commission, I think, some such circumstance caused its omission, though I have observed that in conveyances that were made to him of lands in Ill, in 1835 or 1837, the middle initial was used. (His mother was a member of a family named Plummer, I think.)<br/>When I saw him in the all of 1844 and the winter following, he was living the life of a retired farmer, taking care, however, of the stock, and of the place generally, In the conduct of the meetings which were held in Asbury Chapel, both he and grandmother or Elizabeth Ijams took a prominent part. His voice in speaking was very full and distance, and she was accomplished in the part she sometimes took in such meetings, almost as much as if she had been trained to be a preacher.<br/>I was in company with grandfather Ijams on a visit to Zanesville in Sept. 1844. He wished to see and hear General Lewis Case, formally a resident of that locality. General Cass had been governor of Michigan, and united States Minister to France, and was making a stumping tour as one of the chief leaders in the Democratic party. He spoke in the open square near the court house in Zanesville, old residents, including Rev. David Young, gathered around to hear him.<br/>Grandfather was in the State Legislature of Ohio, both in the lower house and in the senate, as dates as follow: As a member of the H.R. from Fairfield County in the 8th, 920th., and 10th., General Assemblies, 1809-1912. As a member of the Senate in the 20 th. and 21st. General Assemblies 1812-1823. He also sat as one of the side or Associate Judges in the Common Court. This, I think, was after his removal to Muskingum county. He was a Justice of the Peace at times.<br/>He spoke of being in the lower house when Henry Clay, having been elected Senator of the United States, was passing through Chillicothe, then the capital of Ohio, on his way to Washington. A reception was given to Mr. and Mrs. by the members of the Legislature. this I suppose was in 1809.<br/>On one occasion, in the fall of 1844, Grandfather Ijams took a wagon with a yoke of oxen to the timber to get a load of wood, and I accompanied him. The oxen were well broken and usually went along without any trouble. Grandfather dexterously loaded upon the wagon some pretty heavy sticks of wood and he and I took our seats in the front part of the wagon to go home. In going down a hill the oxen started to run, finding it troublesome to keep the wagon in check, loaded as it was, but Grandfather very energetically brought them to a halt pretty soon. His activity and energy were conspicuous. He told me that it would have been dangerous to allow the oxen to run.<br/>It will not be in place for me to enlarge very much on the foregoing sketch. I may be pardoned, however, for referring further but briefly to your father. There are several incidents that crowd my recollection. Perhaps I can with propriety mention one of these. He was visiting at my fathers house in Hennepin, Ill., about 1850 or 1851, and the late Theophilus Lyle Dickey, the Circuit Judge, then engaged in holding the Circuit Court of Putnam County, was at the time the guest of my father and mother. Judge Dickey and your father had one or two interviews together, in public men and affairs were discussed. Your father had, I believe, been among the regular subscribers to and readers of the National Intelligencer, a favorite paper with himself and neighbors, and Judge Dickey was highly interested in his conversation. Your father, however, went away while the court was sitting. learning of this Judge Dickey expressed regret and said that he would have adjourned court to bid him good bye. I mentioned this incident that your father was, on occasions at least, an interesting conversationalist.<br/>I have not learned very much more of the ancestry of Grandfather Ijams. I have understood he had three brothers who came from Maryland to Ohio; their given names being Isaac, William and John. I was advised by a relative that the widow of William was living near Osawkee, Kansas, in 1899. This seemed to me somewhat strange, as I supposed our Great Uncle William Ijams was quite considerably older than his brother Thomas.<br/>Grandmother Sarah Ijams died in child birth, at the time of the birth of Aunt Sarah. Our Great-Grandmother Duvall was, I think living with grandfather Ijams at the time and continued the care of the household and children for the next three years and upwards, until Grandfather Ijams remarried. Grandmother Duvall then had her separate house, in which she had the aid of a servant who came with the family from Maryland; and Grandfather Ijams bought a tract of Hopewell Twp. on which the homestead was thereafter situated.<br/>Four of the nine children of Grandfather Ijams reached ages above 70 years. Aunt Harriet was 77. Aunt Elizabeth was 73. My mother was 78. Uncle William was 77 at death. Your father was 70 when he died. Grandmother Ijams 61.<br/>With best wishes to all,<br/>Signed Thomas Dent<br/>Dated Chicago, Illinois, Sept. 4, 1901.

His parents were Lewis and Eliza (Rodman) Ijams who all together raised seven children (William, Lewis, John, Eliza, Charlotte, Thomas, and Joseph).  In 1851, when Lewis was around ten years old, the family moved to McLean County, IL where they settled in Bloomington.  Lewis’s father worked as a farmer and the family resided on Grove Street.  It is unknown why they chose this location and little is known about Lewis’s life prior to his service during the Civil War.<br/><br/>The Civil War began on April 12, 1861 as Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter, South Carolina in Charleston Harbor.  The fall of Fort Sumter was the beginning of a four year long war that tore the country apart and left hundreds of thousands of men dead or wounded. Thousands of men on the home front were called to action by President Lincoln and Ijams was one of those who answered that call. “From his mother and father, Lewis inherited an ardent love of liberty and when the great contest between the union and slavery forces arose he threw himself into the fight with all the ardor of youth.”<br/><br/>Lewis’ first posting in 1862 was with the 68th Illinois Regiment under the commanding officers of Colonel Elias Stewart, Lieutenant Col. Houston Taylor, and Major George Lackey.  Although Lewis saw little action on the battlefield, he was a part of the superiorly trained company nicknamed “Lackey’s Zouaves,” after its commander Major George Lackey.  Zouaves units were inspired by North African French colonial units that were known for their colorful uniforms and being expert fighters. Not much is known about the fighting style of “Lackey’s Zouaves,” but it was said that companies F and G of the regiment were “especially proficient in the school of the soldier and in skirmish and Zouave drill.”<br/><br/>After a brief guard duty at Camp Butler near Springfield, Illinois, the regiment traveled by rail to Wheeling, Virginia arriving on July 7th.  Two days later they were ordered by the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, to Washington, D.C.  They remained at the “Soldiers Retreat” until July 14th when they marched to Alexandria, Virginia. While the men never fought in battle, they executed their assigned duties swiftly and effectively.  While posted in Alexandria, they cared for the wounded from the Battle of Bull Run and even walked in review before President Lincoln, “having the distinction of being the only Illinois Regiment present on that occasion.”   They were then ordered back to Camp Butler on September 17th where they were mustered out of service on the 26th.<br/><br/>With no fear and superior training, Ijams did not wait long before re-enlisting. This time he was thrust into the very heart of the battle.  He enlisted in Company M of the 16th Illinois Cavalry on May 16, 1863.   After serving for a short time at Camp Butler, the 16th Cavalry was ordered east to Kentucky and then on to eastern Tennessee during the Knoxville Campaign.  A portion of the Illinois Cavalry participated in the battle at Knoxville from October to November of 1863.  One battalion under Major Beers, including Company M, was sent to the Powell Valley where Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia border each other.  They were headed north towards Jonesville, VA where a battle ensued which almost cost Ijams his life.<br/><br/>Jonesville was a small town in the Powell Valley of Lee County, VA. The area was completely closed in by mountain ranges to the North and South, so the town was utilized for supplies and sustenance by both armies. Jonesville was located less than four miles south of Kentucky and six miles north of Tennessee, and the roads to Confederate and Union strongholds were all connected at Jonesville.  During the winter of 1863-1864, Union forces under the command of Major Charles Beeres were sent on a foraging expedition to look for the necessary supplies to help keep Union soldiers alive during the unusually harsh winter. As they went from town to town (which were largely Confederate), it was rumored that Beeres had ordered his troops to burn the courthouse at Jonesville for no reason and to also burn Franklin Academy because he believed it was a Confederate hospital.  Because of this, Confederate troops in the area sought out Beeres and his men to “exact some revenge.”  They would get their chance when Beeres was ordered to take the 16th IL Cavalry (which included Ijams) and the 22nd Ohio Battery, nearly 450 men, and attack a small encampment of Confederate soldiers stationed near Jonesville.<br/><br/>The commanding officer of the Confederate forces of Southwest Virginia and Eastern Tennessee was General William “Grumble” Jones.  He was headquartered in Rogersville, TN in December of 1863 and received word that the 16th Cavalry under Major Beeres was moving towards Jonesville.   Beeres was unaware that additional Confederate forces were being sent to Jonesville to help defend it.  Ijams and the men set up weaponry on the hill west of town. On the morning of January 3, 1864, a surprise attack reigned down on Ijams and his battalion.  All of Company L was captured, but Ijams and his comrades in Company M stood their ground.  They fiercely attacked the Confederates, driving them back and saving the artillery.  During the attack, the captain of Company M was injured and unable to hold his command.  As Sergeant, Ijams took over command of the forces and held this position to the battle’s end.  A nearby house, owned by Andrew Milburn, was used by Union forces as a shelter enabling them to keep the enemy at bay. Srgt. Ijam’s company held on until a rebel force appeared in the east, closing Company M into the valley on all fronts.  The rebel soldiers made another assault, leaving the Union forces with no choice other than surrender.  Around 383 men and officers were captured, 45 wounded and ten killed.  Unfortunately, Srgt. Ijams was seriously wounded during the final attack.  A musket ball pierced his navel, perforated one of his intestines, shattered the top of his hip bone, and exited near the spine.  He was taken to a makeshift hospital at the Milburn house where he was thought to be fatally wounded. Milburn was a union man who provided his home as shelter to the Union soldiers wounded in battle.<br/><br/>As Srgt. Ijams lay there in his bloodied uniform, barely tended to, he persevered.  Although he was initially considered a hopeless case, a sympathetic rebel guard gave him fresh water.  On the second day after the battle, a rebel surgeon examined Ijams and treated his wound only after those who were less severely wounded had been treated.  For two weeks, a nurse poured water over his wound, allowing the intestine to heal.  However, Ijams had become emaciated from lack of proper nutrition and weakened by loss of blood.  The living conditions within the makeshift hospital were also deplorable.  Bare rooms were full of wounded and sick soldiers.  Odors emanating from fever and untreated wounds filled the air.  The attendants were merely rebel soldiers assigned to stand guard.  There was nothing to read, nothing to write, no choice but death or prison.  It is a wonder that Ijams or any of the wounded survived at all.  As the weeks passed, Ijams continued to hold hope.  Milburn provided assistance with little notice from the rebels who guarded the house.  He managed to make Ijams a pair of wooden crutches, which allowed him to move around somewhat.  However, his hip wound was unable to heal completely until all the bone fragments were gone which took about five months.<br/><br/>Soon enough, Srgt. Ijams began to regain strength as his wounds healed.  Thoughts of escape into the unknown wilds were a hopeful alternative to a rebel prison. It was every soldiers fear that after they had healed enough, they would be sent to a confederate prison, worst of all Andersonville.  Without exaggeration, confederate prisons were seemingly places where the enemy was sent, but rarely survived. Thirty-five out of Company L and thirty from Ijams own company out of the 113 captured died in these prisons.  Ijams concealed his recovery progress from his captors with the help of a medical attendant, a Union supporter.   However, the nearest Union forces were quite far away.  Luckily, the guards were somewhat lax in their duties guarding the prisoners as most of the men in the hospital were severally wounded.  The guards feared no escape.  Often on Sundays, the guards would visit the neighborhoods, leaving the hospital beds unattended. This offered Ijams an opportunity for escape.<br/><br/>Ijams, along with six of his comrades made their escape on a Sunday in late March.  With the excuse of retiring early to bed, the guards left the rooms.  By 10 p.m., the seven men slipped out into the night for Union lines.  The Cumberland Gap, their eventual route, had been evacuated by Union forces for some time.  Jonesville, held by Confederates since January 3, was forty miles southwest of the Gap. The Confederate lines spread out twenty miles from Jonesville to the Gap.  Beyond the lines was neutral ground, which had been ravaged by both sides.  The group of seven did not dare take the road to the Gap out of fear that the enemy was near.  Instead, they took to the mountains.  Thanks to Mr. Milburn, they were advised a route and the given names of Union men whom they could rely on for assistance during the journey.  While still on crutches, Ijams was elected leader of the rag tag group.<br/><br/>With wounds tearing and medical supplies low, Ijams led the weakened men through tattered roads, into mud holes, and over boulders for forty miles.  As it was early spring, snow storms hampered their journey and covered roads.  Progress was slow, but rest was not afforded as rebel forces loomed nearby for the first 20 miles.    The first friendly face they came upon was a mountaineer, a loyal supporter of the Union, at about noon on a Monday.  Although they were a poor people and had little to offer, they welcomed the men with warmth and kindness.  The wife offered a scant meal of corn meal and bacon which was a handsome treat for the men.  Even though they were offered shelter for the night, the men moved on out of fear that they would be captured.  What they feared most were guerillas, part of the rebel forces who had deserted only to become dangerous outlaws.  Lead by Ijams, the men passed from one mountain cabin to another, sharing little meals prepared by Union friends.  To avoid detection, the men traveled by night, but the darkness hid obstructions in their path, making the trip no less dangerous.<br/><br/>As they were about to cross the last enemy line into neutral territory they ran into trouble.  The soldiers were warned by a “large, rumpled, mountain woman” that the rebel forces were coming down the main road. Thankfully, they evaded capture and continued on their way.  They made it to neutral territory and after eight more days, they reached a Union hospital in the Cumberland Gap.  Unfortunately the hospital was full and Ijams was forced to sleep in an out building on a bunk made of clapboards.<br/><br/>Although Ijams remained in a weakened condition, he was compelled to leave out of fear of enemy scouting parties visiting the hospital.  If he were captured, he would no doubt have been sent to a confederate prison.   Ijams continued on by himself to Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, the first Union post near his position.  However, it was a 120 mile journey to there on a road “marred by destruction.”  Miles of dead animals and starved horses lined the trail and debris from both armies littered the entire way.  Ijams took advantage of these circumstances, fashioned a saddle from supplies he scavenged, and mounted a weak horse, which was in no better condition than he was.  The journey was a long, hard, and lonely one for Ijams.  Sleet and rain alternated and filled the river beds, making fording impossible.  Ijams anxiety ran high even when approaching Union lines.  He feared that at the last minute he would be “seized by some prowling guerrillas and murdered or captured by some adventurous rebel band and sent to the southern prisons.” Then:<br/><br/>One morning late in April as he was slowly plodding along, he and his horse worn almost to the point of exhaustion, he saw in the distance the first picket in blue of the Union army and away off in the distance floated the starry flag, the emblem of liberty, the hope of the world.  Travelers on foreign lands have attempted to describe their feelings on beholding our flag floating from one of our ships but what did it not mean to him?  Life and liberty and all that can be contained in those imperial words, escape from the rebel prisons, next door to death itself, proper care for his open wounds, rest, rest for the weary worn body, rest for the anxious mind, friends, comrades and home, home sweet home and the dear faces of father and mother. What wonder that completely overcome he wept like a child.<br/><br/>While at Mt. Sterling, he found the other two battalions of his regiment.  He was sent to the hospital and received proper care to his wounds.  Ijams was then sent back home to Bloomington on furlough to recover.  This must have been a great relief to his family since his sister, Mrs. Colwell, had received a letter from a Union Army Officer which informed her that her brother was mortally wounded and dead, presumably in the battle at Jonesville. Upon his return to Bloomington, Ijams was urged to discharge from the army but he could not rest “until the war was over or his life came to an end.”  After thirty days at home in Bloomington, he returned to his regiment.  He then took part in the Hood Campaign, battles of Columbia, Spring Hill, Duck River, Franklin, and Nashville.  Ijams was then promoted to Captain of Co. L based on his outstanding service as a non-commissioned officer.  At the close of the war, he returned home, physically injured, but strong in heart.  He was now deaf in one ear and hearing impaired in the other.<br/><br/>After the war, his life in Bloomington was one of modesty and distinguished civility.  Ijams was twice elected Treasurer of McLean County for the duration of twelve years.    He was involved in the real estate business and also was a member of the First Methodist Church in Bloomington.  As a veteran of the Union Army, Ijams was also eligible to join the Grand Army of the Republic, known as the G.A.R. The G.A.R. was a fraternal organization (much like the American Legion or the Veterans of Foreign Wars today) that was instituted and organized in Springfield, Illinois in 1866. Ijams was a member of the William T. Sherman Post #146 in Bloomington which was organized on July 26, 1882.<br/><br/>Although Capt. Ijams carried himself with great decorum, he became embroiled in an unfortunate (and somewhat embarrassing) situation.  In the fall of 1906, he went to court with a claim against the estate of the late millionaire Abraham Brokaw.  The claim in the amount of $10,000 was for services rendered during Brokaw’s last years. These services, Ijams stated, were of telling stories and jokes under the direction of Mr. Brokaw.  From Ijams early life and history, to the events of the day, Mr. Brokaw included his own stories as well.  Ijams claimed that this job required him to have much knowledge of “people and history,” as he talked every night.  The case was reported in the Daily Pantagraph, on which Ijams claimed “that during the time that he cared for Mr. Brokaw that he did so at the request of the aged man and that the duties were arduous and responsible, exceeding those of a nurse.”  Ijams also recounted that he spent 16 hours tending to business interests, bodily comforts, and offering protection from women who wished to marry Brokaw for his money.  In the end, Ijams was awarded $5,050 from the Brokaw estate and was regrettably likened to a court jester.<br/><br/>Captain Lewis Ijams died at the age of 78 on February 8, 1919 at his home on South McLean St.  He had suffered from uremic poisoning (kidney failure) for a week which gradually grew worse.  He was never married but left behind family and numerous friends.  He was always remembered as a quiet and unassuming gentleman who served his country gallantly.  He most surely would have vanished into history as many of the unsung heroes of the Civil War had it not been for his friends who felt that he should receive his due from all he gave to his country.  He is buried at Evergreen Memorial Cemetery in Bloomington, IL.<br/><br/>By:  Emily Swartz, 2011<br/><br/>Lewis Ijams, a Union soldier, severely wounded and assumed dead on the battlefield, who managed to make it back to Union lines and eventually home.<br/><br/>Edited by:  Candace Summers, 2011
