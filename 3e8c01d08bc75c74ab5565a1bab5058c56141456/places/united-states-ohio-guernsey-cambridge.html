<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote"><b>TRIBUTE TO HELEN LOIS BLAKE (1910-2003), A DEDICATED NOBLE COUNTY NATIVE<br/><br/></b>Published: April 8, 2003 8:00PM<br/>CALDWELL When I read of the death of Helen Lois Blake we all knew her as Lois I was saddened by the nondescript obituary of this lady who had done so much for so many in Noble County and elsewhere. I felt she deserved our gratitude, so I am writing this in her honor.<br/>Lois spent more than 30 years searching family records and historical facts of Ohio's youngest and smallest county. What began with her own family's lineage, soon blossomed into a full time occupation without pay, of course. She knew more about the county and its people than anyone I knew. She was blessed with total recall. An amazing woman who met life's adversities with courage and devoutness.<br/>Her life was never easy. She lost her parents, a brother, husband and daughter to cancer.<br/>She was born in Sharon Township, Aug. 13, 1910, to Rezin and Alta Jane Parrish Iams. There was a polio epidemic in 1914 and three young children contacted the disease in the township: Eva Mae Marquis, Lois and another boy. Dr. William Radcliff had to come by horseback from Caldwell to care for them. Lois's entire right side was affected, and she was left with that leg being shorter than the other. She was fitted with a special shoe, and went about the business of living with confidence even at that young age.<br/>After graduating from Forest Grove High School in 1928, she attended Marietta Commercial College to obtain a degree. She didn't land her first job until 1933.<br/>She met her future husband, Bob Blake, in 1932, when he was employed by the Mills and Wheeler Funeral Home in Caldwell.<br/>Former representative Bob Secrest arranged for her to secure a job in Columbus at the Home Owners Loan Corp. as an expert typist. It was a government project that assisted people to purchase homes under a 20- or 30-year agreement.<br/>Bob secured a job with the same company in Columbus. He had been supporting his widowed mother and three sisters on his $5 weekly salary from the funeral home. His salary jumped to $70 a month.<br/>When the Columbus jobs ended, Secrest hired Bob to help with his campaign for representative. After the successful election, Blake went to Washington, D.C., with Secrest.<br/>In the summer of 1936, Lois also went to the Washington, with Secrest's wife, "Dutch. Lois and Bob were married Feb. 25, 1937, in a ceremony that was arranged by the Secrests. She did a little secretarial work for Secrest during this period<br/>They returned to Noble County in 1939 just in time for the birth of their daughter, Rebecca. Their son, Robert, was born 11 years later. They settled in a home in Sharon Township<br/>Bob became the manager of Driggs Auto Parts on West Street that was located in the VFW building in 1940, a position he held until his death in 1964. He also became clerk of the Sharon Township school board. Lois handled all the writing that the job entailed on one of Forest Grove High School's old typewriters the kind with no letters or numbers.<br/>She realized that she had to learn to drive after her husband's death, which she did promptly with her daughter's help.<br/>She continued to live in their home in Sharon Township until the house was struck by lightning in 1977. She moved into an apartment in Caldwell close to the village square.<br/>She had always been interested in family history, and got involved tracing the Blakes, Tilton and Iams family history. Since Noble County was not formed until 1851 and there are no records before that in the courthouse, she had to travel to the surrounding counties for much of her information.<br/>The Caldwell Public Library was located in the courthouse at that time and had less than a dozen books on history squirreled away in a closet. The micro machine was just a reader and didn't even print, and there were no census films. She began sending for more films.<br/>She starting traveling to search for family histories in all the cemeteries, and soon the Noble County Genealogy Society was formed in October 1983. When the new Caldwell Public Library was constructed in 1989, the records had expanded to two short shelves. The library board created a genealogy room for the accumulating records. And Lois "mother henned" the room from the beginning. She had collected quite a large number of family histories in her home, too, which she gradually moved to the library.<br/>I interviewed this "walking encyclopedia" of Noble County history in 1998. At the time her health had failed somewhat. She was forced to use crutches, which limited her activities. This didn't stop her from compiling records for people many of them former residents. She had done hundreds of family sketches. She got so much satisfaction from helping people.<br/>She used the old typewriter in spite of the fact that her son had purchased a new electric typewriter for her. She just couldn't get used to it. The old typewriter can be seen at the new Noble County Information Center the historic jail museum.<br/>When the Parrish covered bridge was declared unsafe in 1980, Lois donated three plus acres of her land that surrounded the bridge to the commissioners to be used for a park.<br/>Her eyesight and hearing began deteriorating she was almost 90. It became necessary to move closer to her son in Louisiana in 2001. Robert is the head of pharmacology at Xavier University in New Orleans, and his wife is head of ophthalmology at Tulane University.<br/>We miss her, and Noble County should be eternally grateful to her for all she did for us. The genealogy room in the Caldwell Public Library is in existence today because of her diligence and dedication.<br/>(Pat Parks of Caldwell writes Noble County history and related items for The Daily Jeffersonian.
