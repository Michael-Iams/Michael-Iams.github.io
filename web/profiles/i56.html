<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">CHARLES W. WILLIAMS, INDEPENDENCE, IOWA<br/>December 4, 1856 - February 2, 1936<br/>In the late 1880's and early 1890's, Independence, Iowa, was nationally known for horse racing and was sometimes called the "Lexington of the North."<br/><br/>The history of Charles W. WILLIAMS and the stallion Axell has all the charm of a romance, and the vivid series of facts in their joint career to the ultimate climax equal the best efforts of fiction.<br/><br/>Charles W. WILLIAMS was a young telegraph operator at Independence, employed at a meager salary. He had a legacy of a few thousand dollars, and, in connection with a small dairy farm and creamery [in nearby Jesup], conceived the idea of breeding a few trotters. [When Henry L. and Frank D. STOUT] sold some of their stock that didn't meet with standards, WILLIAMS bought two mares the STOUTS felt were worthless. WILLIAMS paid $150 for one of the mares. She was not fashionably bred, though she had good blood in her veins, as she was by Mambrino Boy, a son of Mambrino Patchen; her dam was Bird Mitchell. [WILLIAMS] decided to mate this mare, Lou, with a son of George Wilkes, and his means being limited, he selected William L., one of the youngest sons of that great sire. [William L. and George Wilkes' blood line went back to Rysdyky's Hambletonian, the founding sire of the Standardbred breed of America.]<br/><br/>Lou's foal, Axtell was born on March 31, 1886. As a colt, Axtell was plain-looking, willful and stubborn. He didn't exhibit a great flight of speed so WILLIAMS offered him for sale at $3,000 in the spring of 1888, but couldn't find a buyer. Axtell wasn't hitched to sulky until May 26, 1888.<br/><br/>When he made his first appearance at Keokuk, the colt had not trotted forty times to a sulky. According to experts, Axtell's gait was not artificial but "taught by patient and long continued efforts."<br/><br/>As a two-year-old, Axel trotted in 2:23 [at Keokuk, Iowa]. When he was three-years-old he reduced his record to 2:12 [at Des Moines, Iowa]. What is still more remarkable is the fact that the ex-telegraph clerk was his own trainer and driver. WILLIAMS gave the great colt all his preliminary training, drove him in all his races, and the severity of his methods and the enormous amount of work which he gave him caused the ablest trainers on the turf to predict his early breakdown. But, strange to say, the failure never came, and the marvelous colt went from one victory to another.<br/><br/>Axtell won every race in which he started. Axell achieved his final victory [at Terre Haute, Indiana on October 11, 1889 in 2:12], after which he was sold for $105,000, at the time the highest price ever paid for a horse of any breed.<br/><br/>NOTE: The racing syndicate headed by <b>William Putnam IJAMS</b> and John CONLEY purchased Axtell. The $105,000 they paid was $30,000 more than any one had paid for a horse previously. Budd DOBLE, who had moved his entourage from California to Terre Haute, resumed Axtell's training. As a four-year-old, Axtell broke down and never raced again, but retired to stud at Warren Park Farm in Terre Haute, Indiana, receiving a $1,000 stud fee.<br/><br/>It is a signal commentary on the prosperity of the turf that his stud fees, in less than three years, have more than covered the cost of his purchase, and that in the ordinary course of nature he will for many years to come bring in a large revenue to his owners.<br/>~ Outing, Vol. 22, Issue 3, p. 196. June 3, 1893.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">WILLIAM P. IJAMS, Terre Haute, was born at Marietta, Ohio, January 18, 1847, and is a son of Rufus P.and Mary Burch Ijams, natives of Ohio, and of English descent. The father, who was a prosperous merchant, resides at Warren Park, in Vigo county, the noted stock farm.<br/><br/>Our subject, who is the second in a family of three children, spent his childhood in Washington county, Ohio, where he attended the common schools of Marietta. His first employment was as bill clerk for the Marietta Railroad Company, in which he continued until 1872, when he came to Indiana and accepted a position with the South Western Railroad Company, as book-keeper. He has occupied various railroad positions, and in 1883 he became president of the Indianapolis Belt Railroad Company. He has been eminently successful in great business enterprises. He purchased the Terre Haute House, and organized the present company, superintending the remodeling and refitting of the hotel, which under his presidency and management has become one of the noted hostelries of the country.<br/><br/>He is the owner of Warren Park, .which comprises nearly 1,000 acres, and is today perhaps one of the most noted horse farms in America, especially in the line of trotting-bred horses. In his stables are over one hundred, and among them is the most noted stallion in the world -- Axtel. More money was paid for this three-year old ($105,000) than was ever before in all history paid for any animal. When the hump-backed king offered his "kingdom for a horse," his title was shaky, and hence his offer that has been so noted in history, was little less than ten per cent of the cash paid for Axtel, On this farm are two horses, which hitched together reveal $150,000 worth of horse flesh—about $100 per pound, taking gross weight of team. Warren Park with its celebrity is chiefly the conception of Mr. Ijams, and to him is due the success it has attained. This has advertised Terre Haute throughout the civilized world. Mr. Ijams has not confined his energies on his farm to horses alone, but has given intelligent attention to cattle as well. He has served as president of the Vigo County Agricultural Society, and is at this time president of the Vigo County Trotting Association.<br/><br/>Mr. Ijams was married to Miss Sallie Warren, a daughter of the late Levi Warren, who was an early settler in Terre Haute, and one of its leading men and most influential citizens. He was a man of great enterprises, one who contributed as much to the growth and prosperity of the city and county as any man ever did in it.  His death, in the vigor of his useful life, was regarded by all as a public calamity. The happy union of Mr. and Mrs. Ijams has been blessed with three children, viz. : Warren, Alice and Burch. Mr. and Mrs. Ijams are members of the Episcopal Church.  In the social life of the city this family have the sincerest of friends.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">William P. Ijams, for many years a leading figure in the financial and social life of Terre Haute, was born in Marietta, Ohio. He received his education in the schools of his native community, and at the age of sixteen years, volunteered for service in the Union Army in the Civil war. He was in the command of General Wood, and saw much hard fighting.<br/><br/>After being honor ably discharged from the army, he returned to civilian life at Marietta, but soon left there to come to Terre Haute, arriving in this city in 1870. Soon after his arrival here, he was appointed superintendent of construction for the Indianapolis Belt Line Railroad and the Union Stock Yards of that city. Upon completion of the railroad, W. R. McKeen was made its president, and later Mr. Ijams held this position for many years. He was prominently identified with the steel business and many other enterprises of note. He recently disposed of his stock in the Terre Haute House, of which he held a directing part with Mr. Crawford Fairbanks. He was influential in establishing many of the city's industries, and devoted much time to constructive work in the community. For many years he was paymaster of the old Logansport, Crawfordsville & Southeastern Railroad before it was absorbed by the Vandalia Railroad Company (now the Pennsylvania). He was also one of the organizers of the Citizens Telephone Company, was executive and director in a number of Terre Haute financial institutions, and was president and third owner of the Indiana Steel Company. He promoted the Grand Opera House, and was a life-long friend and business associate of Mr. Demas Deming.<br/><br/>No one, perhaps, has ever been more closely connected with the development of the trot ting horse than was Mr. Ijams. Horses and their breeding and racing were his hobbies, and he won world-wide fame in this sport. He was one of the founders of the American Trotting Association, and for nearly forty years was its president. With a syndicate he bought Axtell, the famous race horse, from C. W. Williams, of Iowa, for $105,000, a transaction which created a great sensation. Axtell was a three-year-old stallion at this time, with a record of 2:12 made with an old-fashioned high-wheeled sulky, a crude af fair from the present day standards, having neither rubber tires nor ball bearings. Axtell was the sire of many famous horses, includ ing Axworthy and Lee Axworthy. Mr. Ijams promoted the Grand Circuit races here, and maintained a select stable for many years at Warren Park Farm, one of the show places of Indiana, located near Terre Haute.<br/><br/>He was very fond of hunting and out-door life, and owned the O. X. Bar Ranch, a large estate located on the Powder River in Wyoming, near the home of Col. William F. Cody, popularly known as "Buffalo Bill." Mr. Ijams was popular in fraternal and social circles, and was a Thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason, a member of the Mystic Shrine and a Knight Templar in all of which organizations he took a deep interest. Like his parents, whose home in Ohio was the rendezvous of ministers of that faith, he was a member of St. Stephen's Episcopal church at Terre Haute. He was united in marriage to Miss Sallie Warren, of Terre Haute, and they were the parents of three children : Frank Burch, elsewhere mentioned, Warren and Alice. Mrs. Ijams was the daughter of Levi G. Warren, an account of whose life will be found in this work. Mr. Warren was the organizer and first president of the old State Bank of Indiana at Terre Haute, and was for years one of this city's leading citizens. Mr. Ijams dropped practically all of his business interests during the last years of his life, he lived with his family at No. 400 North Seventh street, and the home was the scene of many brilliant social functions throughout his life. His long and useful career was brought to a close on the 22d day of March, 1922, and in his death the citizens of Terre Haute suffered a great and irreplaceable loss.
