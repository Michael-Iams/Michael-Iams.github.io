<li class="gt-list-item gt-text">p 249-251, Volume 2<br/><br/><b>IAMS, Lucy Virginia Dorsey (Nov. 13, 1855—Oct. 26, 1924)</b>, Pittsburgh welfare worker and leader in reform legislation, was born in Oak-land, Md., the first daughter and third of the four children of James Francis and Charlotte (Hook) Dorsey. Her father, a Virginia-born Methodist minister who also practiced medicine, and her mother, a native of Pennsylvania, were both descended from seventeenth-century Maryland settlers. Following the death of her husband in the late 1850's, Mrs. Dorsey returned to her parents' home in Waynesburg, Greene County, Pa., where the children were raised by their grandparents after her own death a few years later. Lucy Dorsey graduated from Waynesburg College (B.A., 1873) and taught public school for several years. On Aug. 12, 1877, she was married to Franklin Pierce Jams; they had two sons, Jay Donald and Jesse Dorsey. A lawyer active in Democratic party affairs, Iams in 1886 shifted his practice from Waynesburg to Pittsburgh. His wife became proficient in legal matters herself; she served as his secretary, read extensively in the law, and launched a successful career as a court stenographer, one that she continued during her active years in social reform. This legal background undoubtedly stimulated her interest in the social problems of the Pittsburgh area, and it greatly enhanced her usefulness to welfare organizations. Supplementing her skills in the preparation and analysis of legislation was a political realism to which her husband immersed in local and state politics probably contributed. Slight in size, blue-eyed, with fine facial features, bright and alert, friendly but undemonstrative, Mrs. It was firm, dire., and practical in pursuit of her objectives.<br/><br/>The key organization through which she worked for social betterment was the Civic Club of Allegheny County, established in 1895. Becoming vice-president and chairman of its Social Science Department in 1902, she held the first post for the remainder of her life, and until the 1920's she headed the club's legislation until the 1920's she headed the club's legislative committee as well. In this strategic post she contributed substantially to the Civic Club's reputation as a leading welfare agency of the Pittsburgh region and the instigator of reforms in health, housing, recreation, and education, beginning several years before the famed Pittsburgh Survey of 1907-08. Mrs. Iams also served as it director or member of the legislative committees of such organizations as the State Federation of Pennsylvania Women (chairman of legislation, 1903-23), the Consumers' League of Western Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania and Allegheny County Child Labor Associations, and the Associated Charities of Pittsburgh. In a sense she acted as an informal coordinator of reform legislation for western Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Mrs. Iams' interests included legal aid, woman suffrage, vocational training, charity organization, mental hygiene, and conservation, but her outstanding contributions were in the areas of housing, health, woman and child welfare, and correctional institutions. As chairman of the Civic Club's legislative committee she played a role in the establishment of the Soho Public Baths (1904), medical inspection of children in the Pittsburgh public schools, the Allegheny County Industrial and Training School for Boys at Thornhill (1909), and the Pennsylvania Village for Feeble Minded Women at Laurelton (1913). She served as a director of the Children's Service Bureau of Pittsburgh and in the child welfare division of the Public Charities Association of Pennsylvania. She was among those who urged the establishment of a federal Children's Bureau, a Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (achieved in 1913), and a Pennsylvania Public Welfare Department (established 1921). In 1921, the same year she its unsuccessfully for election to the Pittsburgh City Council, Gov. Gifford Pinchot appointed her it trustee of the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania. During her three years of service she won the respect of the inmates, who described her as a "good friend" and "most remarkable woman."<br/><br/>Lawrence Veiller of New York, the nation, most influential housing reformer in the early twentieth century, regarded Mrs. Iams as Pitts-burgh's "pioneer worker" in housing betterment. Chairman of the Civic Club's tenement house committee, she was instrumental in the drafting and enactment of the state tenement house law of 1903 (affecting cities classified by size as second class, at that time Pittsburgh and Scranton). She also won an appropriation from the Pittsburgh City Council for inspectors to enforce the legislation. Mrs. Iams soon realized, as did housing reformers elsewhere, that housing codes had to be defended against continuous pressures from organized building interests, and as early as 1904 she advised the Civic Club of the need for a city-wide housing association. It was not until 1910, however, that the Civic Club's housing committee, in cooperation with the Chamber of Commerce and Civic Commission, succeeded in establish-ing a Pittsburgh Housing Conference. Mrs. lams' influence in improving housing extended beyond Pittsburgh—as an adviser to communities in the state interested in housing legislation, and as a director of the Pennsylvania Housing and Town Planning Association and Pennsylvania Housing Association.<br/><br/>Lucy Dorsey Iams once admitted that the key to success as a reformer was skill in political maneuver. She explained, in this connection, that Pennsylvania's housing law of 1903 was not attributable to any mass public interest or pressure. On behalf of the Civic Club and advised by one "astute" politician, she placed the measure in the hands of another such politician, thus launching it through the state legislature in Harrisburg. A Methodist but not an active churchgoer, Mrs. Iams enjoyed literature, music, the theatre, and gardening. She died of pneumonia in Pittsburgh at the age of sixty-eight and was buried in Allegheny Cemetery, Pittsburgh. An unusual combination of housewife, court stenographer, and social reformer, she ranked among the best practitioners of reform politics in the early twentieth century and played a particularly important role in stimulating housing reform in western Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>[The <i>Annual Reports</i> of the Civic Club of Allegheny County indicate the range and importance of Mrs. Iams' reform efforts. Similarly useful were the early <i>Minutes of the Civic Club</i> and a folder containing newspaper clippings and other material concerning Mrs. Tams, both in the Civic Club archives and made available through the courtesy of Mrs. Helen B. LaMonte, Executive Secretary. Sketches of Mrs. Iams appear in the <i>Woman's Who's Who of America, 1914-15</i>, and in Gertrude B. Biddle and Sarah D. Lowrie, eds., <i>Notable Women of Pa. (1942)</i>. Data concerning her husband, Franklin P. Iams, may be found in the <i>Nat. Cyc. Am. Biog</i>., VIII. 80. The author is greatly indebted to Miss Charlotte D. lams, a granddaughter, and to Mr. Jesse D. Jams, a son, for their help during the preparation of the article.]<br/><br/>ROY LUBOVE</li>
