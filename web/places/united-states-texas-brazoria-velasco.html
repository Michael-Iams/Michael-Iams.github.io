However, on May 7, 1864, when he was not quite eighteen, he and a few other very young men joined the 13th Texas Infantry. They were quickly deployed to Velasco, to help guard the Texas coast. Over the next year, Ijams wrote a series of letters to his family. Five of them survived, and were donated to the Nesbitt Memorial Library through Millycent Cordes by the heirs of Ethel "Essie" Hammons on May 19, 2008. They are transcribed below. The letters were directed to Ijams' parents, Basil Gaither Ijams and Louisa Hunt Cunningham Ijams, to his sisters, Margaret Jennie Ijams Cone (whom he called "Jince") and Nancy Anna Ijams (whom he called "Nollie"), and to his niece Mary Louisa Clapp. In two instances, the younger Ijams wrote to more than one person on a single sheet of paper. He is not known to have married, and died not long after the war, on February 14, 1868. His sister Jennie Cone (1839-1901) had a son, Wilson Ross Cone (1866-1913). His daughter, Ethel Kathryn Cone (1895-1976), married Basil Edward Burford. Their daughter, Ethel Burford (1926-2007), married Walter Lee Hammons. It must be supposed that each of these generations owned the letters before they were donated to the library..<br/> <br/><i><b>1.

Basil Gaither Ijams to Basil Gaither Ijams and Louisa Hunt Cunningham Ijams, June 30, 1864<br/></b></i>  <br/><br/>Camp Velasco June the 30th 1864<br/> <br/>Dear Mother and Father I take this presant oportunity of writing you a fiew lines as Uncle William is go up. I received a letter from Ma, Jince, & Nollie, and was glad to hear that you all were well. I am well and getting along fine I am sorry to hear that Uncle Ellison is no better and I fear he will never have his rite mind any more, I have no news to write though. I must try to write some John Clapp has been sick ever since he got to camps but he is improveing and the Dr has assigned him for duty but he is not able to undertake to stand guard and the ordely will not put it on him. This is genneral review but I am clear of that and dont have to be exammined be cause I am on guard and the guard dont have to be exammined. I have had the luck to be on piquet at the beech evry since I have been down here and have been the third relief so you see I dont have to stand but two hours a night. They have quit issuing us flour so you see we dont have sutch good eating. dont grumble when a soldier asks you for a little milk but just give it to him for you cannot know how it is to be with out it and what a treat it is to get it. We get a pan of clobber every morning from Mrs Behrans Kiss little Cassie for me and tell her bus will <s>make</s> send her one little ring too to put on her little ringer. Tell Jince and Nollie that I will not write to them until after, I have writen to sis Em, as I prommised to write to her first. Give my pigs a plenty of milk and make them fat and when Jimmie <s>comes</s> goes up kill one and send me half baked nice. I am very sorry to hear that the storm blew so mutch off our corn down We had a storm the first night I went on guard and blew the tent down on us. Oh yes I have some news too The Yankees came in the other day mondy and gave us a fiew shots 25 the shell flew in evry direction but we made them get out of range of our guns quicker the fight occured a bout that little old schooner that I wrote you about last sunday. Charley is getting along firstrait and wants to go home since the Yanks gave us them shell it scared him very badly but I did not care for it evry body ran to where they could see I got on the fort where I could see evry thing and be out of danger. so no more you must excuse bad wrting and spelling as I am in a hurry<br/> <br/>Your son<br/>Gaither
