She looked forward every year to her annual family beach trip to Ocean City where lasting memories were made and weeks were filled with laughter. She gained a second family in the nurses and doctors who cared for her tirelessly over the last five years at the Schwab Cancer Center during her courageous battle. <br/>Judy is survived by her husband, Chazz; her children, Kelly Robinson and husband, Craig, Todd Imes and wife, Jamie, Robin Yoder and husband, Dave, Rodney Imes and wife, Shannon, Julie Marrale and husband, Mike, Hope Harris and husband, Jon and her grandchildren, Kyle, Cadyn and Taylor Robinson, Kai, Ian, Sean, Trinity, Simmy, Chazz, Eli, Julia and Lydia Imes, Chad Yoder and wife, Ashlyn, Jared Yoder and wife, Lauren; Carter and Carson Imes, Sloane, Morgan, and Michael Marrale and Jona and Hunter Harris.

I have seen reference that this William was the son of Richard Iiams and his 2nd wife Elizabeth Gaither. But, the date of this William’s birth somewhere around or after 1718 does not comport with the dates of the birth of his children. He would have been nearly 58 years old before the birth ofhis first child Mary. Does anyone have more detailed information on this William Iiams and Elizabeth of Breakneck Road, East of Cumberland, MD?
