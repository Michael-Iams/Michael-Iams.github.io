<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">J. Hill Iams born June 2, 1822, died Feb. 26, 1890, at his home in Washington County, Pa. For long years he had been afflicted with a cough which culminated in pulmonary trouble. He had been in poor health for two or three years past and a few days prior to his death he was seized with the gripe which resulted fatally.<br/>Nearly twenty years ago he connected himself with the North Ten Mile Baptist Church, and in 1873 he removed his letter and became one of the constituent members of the Mt. Zion Baptist Church. He was a firm believer and often longed for his time to come. His affliction was born uncomplainingly. He was upright and honorable in all his dealings with his fellow men. On Friday, Feb. 28, at 11 AM, a large number of relatives, friends and neighbors convened at his residence and listened to a discourse by Rev. A. J. Meek of Waynesburg from Psalms ?0:12. The interment took place at the Franklin burial grounds. A widow is left to mourn his death.<br/>"Note" This obit had a crease up the middle and some of the words were hard to make out.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Mrs. Hannah M. Iams, wife of W. L. Iams, died at her home on East College Street, this place, Sabbath evening, April 21, 1895, ten minutes to six o'clock.<br/>She had suffered for several years with asthma. On the Monday night previous to her faith, she took a heavy cold, as they believed, but it developed into congestion of the lungs together with la grippe. It was a severe shock to the family and friends, as she appeared better Sabbath morning. She bore her suffering patiently, and was always bright and cheerful. She lived to make the world better for her having lived in it. She was a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and a very earnest and devoted Christian. In the Sunday School, and in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, she was always willing to perform her part of the work. On the Sabbath evening before she died, she took part in the Easter services, having drilled a class of little girls. A friend speaking to her about it during her sickness remarked: "Mrs. Iams, I fear you worked too hard and exposed yourself preparing for the Easter services." Her reply was:"Somebody had to do it." She never said:" I can't, but , "I will try," was her motto when asked to work for her Master.<br/><br/>The church has lost an earnest worker, the Sabbath School a faithful teacher, the husband a loving, cheerful and industrious wife, and the daughter a noble mother. While she felt if she could be spared a few years longer she could accomplish more for humanity, yet if it was the Lord's will, she was willing to obey the call. It was her dying request that they sing and pray. As the friends were singing "Nearer My God To Thee" she made a feeble attempt to join with them, but she was too weak to utter an audible sound. The three most beautiful words seemed linked together-ful - "Mother, Home, and Heaven" She seemed to realize the words of the hymn, and was drawing nearer and nearer. And as He was passing by she reached out her hand and touched the border of His garmet, "and the woman was made whole from that hour," She closed her eyes in sleep-"Asleep in Jesus, Blessed Sleep, From Which None Ever Wake to Weep, From Which None Ever Wake to Weep."<br/>The Memorial Services were conducted by Rev. A. B. Miller, DD, of the C. P. Church, after which the remains were borne to Greene Mount cemetery, where they were laid to rest. The husband and daughter have the sympathy of a large circle of friends, as was manifested by their presence as a token of respect.<br/><br/>LNPM

She had been afflicted with consumption for nearly a year. Gradually her disease wore her away until it culminated in death at the above stated time. About seven years ago she with about thirty others professed faith in Christ and connected herself with the Mt. Zion Baptist Church. Her life was consistent and her influence was good. She was the first of the number who joined the church to break the ranks and go home. She was conscious to the end. At her request her parents were called to her bedside and she bade them an affectionate farewell and then passed away to her Savior whom she loved. She made request that Rev. A. J. Meek should preach a funeral discourse which he did from Rev. 22:4, at 10 AM April 13, April 13, 1890. A large concourse of friends followed her remains to the North Ten Mile cemetery when the Imterment took place.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Hon. Thomas Iams<br/>The subject of this notice died at his home in Morris Township on Saturday, Feb. 19, 1881, in the 60th year of his age. He was attacked about three weeks since with a severe cold which resulted in the affection of the prostate gland and of the bladder, from which he died. His wife and five children, survive him, two of whom Frank P. Iams, Esq., and Mrs. J. W. Ray reside in Waynesburg. His remains were brought to town on Monday morning’s train accompanied ny numerous friends, and he was buried from the depot, in Greene Mount Cemetery.<br/>Judge Iams had lived for the last 28 years of his life on the farm on which he died, which comprises upward of 650 acres of good land. He was an enterprising farmer, and had made the most substantial and elegant improvements on his farm. He was a very prominent citizen, having served one term as treasurer of the county, and another as Associate Judge, and for several years a Director of the W&W Railroad to which he had contributed liberally of his means. He was highly respected as a citizen and honored as a public officer, and his loss will be deeply felt and mourned, not only by a large and respectable family connection, but by the community at large.<br/>"Note" He is in my tree as the s/o Otho Iams which is stated in "Bates" book on Thomas Iams grandson, Otha's biography.<br/><br/>LNPM
