To our knowledge they were the first African-American family homesteading in Benzie County, Michigan. William Davis (born abt. 1814, PA) homesteaded 160 acres and so did his son Joseph B. and Joseph’s <b>brother in law David Imes</b>. The township of Joyfield did not have a cemetery. William and Mildred (Brand) Davis sold 5 aces for $35 to the township for the cemetery and it was named Joyfield Cemetery. Oral history handed down for over 60 years reveals that William Davis is believed to be one of the three children of the Scotch-Irish plantation owner and African slave.<br/>William’s oldest son, Joseph Brand Davis born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania 22 March 1839, died on February of 1915, at the ripe age of 76.<b> Joseph's first wife was Mary Bell Imes</b>; they had one son named Horace Burr Davis. He was born abt. 1864. Horace was the first baby to be born in Joyfield Township after the township got its name.<br/>Horace Davis died in 1914, when his son Calvin was only two years old. Hattie, Calvin mother's was left with a house, land and a few dollars, which was more than enough for her to live on and support the family. If that wasn't enough for the Davis's siblings, their mother Hattie, died on April 30,1919, just five years after their father. Bessie, one of Calvin’s older sisters, was working as a live-in housekeeper when their mother died. Upon her mother’s death, she quit her job and returned home to take care of her three young brothers, Ferman, Floyd and Calvin. Bessie didn't have much to live on, and they were very poor. Bessie used to talk about the hard times she had with raising her three young brothers (personal interview, 1975). She said that they were literally starving and being poor was an understatement. To give us an idea of how hungry and poor they were, she commented that she would buy one apple and cut it up for all four of them to eat.<br/>Calvin Clark Davis attended the Malcolm School, Manistee County. According to information submitted by John W. Martin, who provided a history on the Malcolm School, the 1922-23-school term started late in August with 26 pupils making up eight grades. The Davis, Marsh, Reed, and other children used a well-worn path through the fields, woods, and across the railroad track, being a direct half-mile to walk to school. If the round about roads had been used, the distance would have more than doubled.<br/>Calvin attended Bear Lake High School, class of 1932. While in high school he sang in the Glee Club and set a new regional record in the half mile run. Calvin always dreamed of becoming being a pilot. But knew it was out of his reach, they wouldn't allow him to attend pilot school being an African-American. He was very light skinned and settled to be a radio gunner. He entered the military May 14, 1941, prior to the Tuskegee Airman; there is no indication that anyone ever asks him what race he was.<br/>Pacific Tour<br/>According to the newspaper article, he graduated from army radio school and after running a radio station at Rapid City, South Dakota, for some time he finally was picked for combat duty in a heavy bombardment group. He arrived in New Guinea June 30, 1943, and started combat flying three weeks after his arrival. From there he flew on many missions, some very long and some shorter. Although he completed combat flying well into July of 1943, Calvin had completed his 300 hours of flying, or 50+ missions in a few months, According to the newspaper reports, Calvin was wounded on both the first and last missions, for which he received the Purple Heart. (He flew on Captain Showalter’s, Pride of the Yanks)<br/>News again November 26, 1943, reported that Calvin, as a Tech Sergeant was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for Heroism in flight and exceptional and outstanding accomplishment in the face of great danger above and beyond the call of duty over Wewak. New Guinea on August 29, 1943. (Attached)<br/>News again, April 11, 1944 reported that Calvin was cited for Heroism at Rabaul, and visited his sister Bessie Marsh for a well-earned rest. According to this article it is quoted that Calvin started combat flying in July of 1943, he had completed his 300 hours of flying, or 50 missions, which included two-week rest periods and being grounded for one month. In addition, he was awarded for heroic service, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and two oak leaf clusters, and was been recommended for the Silver Star. According to this article, it stated that with Calvin winning two more medals, he would be eligible for the Congressional Medal of Honor. During this time he was in the 5th Air Force, 90th Bomb Group, 400th Squadron,<br/>June 2, 1944 news reported that Calvin Davis was one of four Michigan fliers of the 5th Air Force awarded the Oak Leaf Cluster. How did Calvin survive hiding his race, you asked? Well for one thing, he never spoke of his family, so no one ever suspected that he was African-American, due to being very light-skinned. The mood of the US regarding African-Americans serving was vicious. During WW2, blacks were allowed to do certain type of jobs, such as cooks and maintenance workers. Separate facilities were set up for the black soldiers and white soldiers. Calvin was not among them, he was with the white soldiers, but didn’t associate that much. He kept to him self, but word has it, that he was somewhat of a ladies man. He had several girl friends, but never married or had any children.<br/>Europe Tour<br/>November 7, 1944, Elmer Short of Bear Lake reported that he turned on his radio and heard Cal Davis speaking form London. A few days later a photo was released with Calvin Davis pictured during the BCC radio broadcast from London England<br/>The event that Calvin was being interviewed was the American Red Cross RainbowCorner in London, during the BBC program, “The American Eagle in Britain". Calvin Davis was a decorated WWII solider, had a dream of being a pilot and knew that he could not enter the service to serve his country because of his race. Information received on Calvin Davis's last mission serving his country should not go untold.<br/>He flew with a crew of the "Asterisk", a B-17, (8th AF 390 BG, 570 Sq) over Germany. Research showed that Everett Fitchlee was ill and in the hospital, he is alive and doing well at the age of 78. He told me that he remembered Cal Davis, and didn't know until several years ago what had happened to his crewmates. He saw William "Bill" Pace at a 390BG reunion. He suggested that we contact him, since Pace was on the last mission with Calvin Davis. Mr. Fitchlee said it hit him hard, finding out what had happened.<br/>According to the military records the Asterisk was involved in a crash over Merseburg Germany, all of the crew was killed, except three soldiers, which they were taken as POW's. We contacted Bill Pace for details of the mission. It was exciting to talk to someone that flew with Calvin Davis. Bill stated that they were flying their 13th mission. They were flying right wing to the lead plane. The mission was to bomb the oil refineries in Meresburg. Shots were coming from everywhere, the lead plane was hit and fell right on them and the Asterisk split in half. He said where Cal was at; there was no way out, the pilot, co-pilot and engineer as well as Cal, as the radio gunner went down. They were all killed, with the exception of himself, Raymond Labinski and Custer Green; they became POW's. Bill said he went to Stalag I.<br/>Mr. Pace commented that Cal was well liked by everyone and it was a pleasure knowing and flying with him (personal interview 2002). He had no idea that Cal was African-American. He was shocked, said that Calvin never said anything about his family. Said that they met Davis on the airbase in the NCO club they needed a radio gunner, and Cal wanted to fly with them, in which he did. He did say that Calvin was older than the rest of the crew, and they knew that he was with the 5th Air Force. Bill said he asked him why did he sign up for another tour, and Calvin replied, “ I don’t think I‘ve done enough”.<br/>January 9, 1945, TSgt, Calvin Davis, reported missing in action over Germany.
