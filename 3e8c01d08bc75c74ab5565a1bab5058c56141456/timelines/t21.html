<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote"><b>TRIBUTE TO HELEN LOIS BLAKE (1910-2003), A DEDICATED NOBLE COUNTY NATIVE<br/><br/></b>Published: April 8, 2003 8:00PM<br/>CALDWELL When I read of the death of Helen Lois Blake we all knew her as Lois I was saddened by the nondescript obituary of this lady who had done so much for so many in Noble County and elsewhere. I felt she deserved our gratitude, so I am writing this in her honor.<br/>Lois spent more than 30 years searching family records and historical facts of Ohio's youngest and smallest county. What began with her own family's lineage, soon blossomed into a full time occupation without pay, of course. She knew more about the county and its people than anyone I knew. She was blessed with total recall. An amazing woman who met life's adversities with courage and devoutness.<br/>Her life was never easy. She lost her parents, a brother, husband and daughter to cancer.<br/>She was born in Sharon Township, Aug. 13, 1910, to Rezin and Alta Jane Parrish Iams. There was a polio epidemic in 1914 and three young children contacted the disease in the township: Eva Mae Marquis, Lois and another boy. Dr. William Radcliff had to come by horseback from Caldwell to care for them. Lois's entire right side was affected, and she was left with that leg being shorter than the other. She was fitted with a special shoe, and went about the business of living with confidence even at that young age.<br/>After graduating from Forest Grove High School in 1928, she attended Marietta Commercial College to obtain a degree. She didn't land her first job until 1933.<br/>She met her future husband, Bob Blake, in 1932, when he was employed by the Mills and Wheeler Funeral Home in Caldwell.<br/>Former representative Bob Secrest arranged for her to secure a job in Columbus at the Home Owners Loan Corp. as an expert typist. It was a government project that assisted people to purchase homes under a 20- or 30-year agreement.<br/>Bob secured a job with the same company in Columbus. He had been supporting his widowed mother and three sisters on his $5 weekly salary from the funeral home. His salary jumped to $70 a month.<br/>When the Columbus jobs ended, Secrest hired Bob to help with his campaign for representative. After the successful election, Blake went to Washington, D.C., with Secrest.<br/>In the summer of 1936, Lois also went to the Washington, with Secrest's wife, "Dutch. Lois and Bob were married Feb. 25, 1937, in a ceremony that was arranged by the Secrests. She did a little secretarial work for Secrest during this period<br/>They returned to Noble County in 1939 just in time for the birth of their daughter, Rebecca. Their son, Robert, was born 11 years later. They settled in a home in Sharon Township<br/>Bob became the manager of Driggs Auto Parts on West Street that was located in the VFW building in 1940, a position he held until his death in 1964. He also became clerk of the Sharon Township school board. Lois handled all the writing that the job entailed on one of Forest Grove High School's old typewriters the kind with no letters or numbers.<br/>She realized that she had to learn to drive after her husband's death, which she did promptly with her daughter's help.<br/>She continued to live in their home in Sharon Township until the house was struck by lightning in 1977. She moved into an apartment in Caldwell close to the village square.<br/>She had always been interested in family history, and got involved tracing the Blakes, Tilton and Iams family history. Since Noble County was not formed until 1851 and there are no records before that in the courthouse, she had to travel to the surrounding counties for much of her information.<br/>The Caldwell Public Library was located in the courthouse at that time and had less than a dozen books on history squirreled away in a closet. The micro machine was just a reader and didn't even print, and there were no census films. She began sending for more films.<br/>She starting traveling to search for family histories in all the cemeteries, and soon the Noble County Genealogy Society was formed in October 1983. When the new Caldwell Public Library was constructed in 1989, the records had expanded to two short shelves. The library board created a genealogy room for the accumulating records. And Lois "mother henned" the room from the beginning. She had collected quite a large number of family histories in her home, too, which she gradually moved to the library.<br/>I interviewed this "walking encyclopedia" of Noble County history in 1998. At the time her health had failed somewhat. She was forced to use crutches, which limited her activities. This didn't stop her from compiling records for people many of them former residents. She had done hundreds of family sketches. She got so much satisfaction from helping people.<br/>She used the old typewriter in spite of the fact that her son had purchased a new electric typewriter for her. She just couldn't get used to it. The old typewriter can be seen at the new Noble County Information Center the historic jail museum.<br/>When the Parrish covered bridge was declared unsafe in 1980, Lois donated three plus acres of her land that surrounded the bridge to the commissioners to be used for a park.<br/>Her eyesight and hearing began deteriorating she was almost 90. It became necessary to move closer to her son in Louisiana in 2001. Robert is the head of pharmacology at Xavier University in New Orleans, and his wife is head of ophthalmology at Tulane University.<br/>We miss her, and Noble County should be eternally grateful to her for all she did for us. The genealogy room in the Caldwell Public Library is in existence today because of her diligence and dedication.<br/>(Pat Parks of Caldwell writes Noble County history and related items for The Daily Jeffersonian.

Arizona was still a territory when Harold was born March 6, 1910 in Tombstone, Az. His first vivid memories were of the war going on across the border (Mexican Revolution with refugees, cavalry troop movements and raids across the border). Harold graduated from Tombstone High School in 1928. He moved to Tucson in 1936, where he operated Rockgas Service Co. with his uncle Clyde Ijams for three decades at 410 N. 4th Ave.<br/><br/>Harold lived so long he was predeceased by almost everyone he knew, including parents, Sheldon and Jessie Ijams of Safford, Az and four brothers, Ed, Mel, Les and William. He is survived by his loving wife of 67 years, Dorothy, brothers James (Maxine) and Carl Phillip (Anne), sons Donald (Kay) and Kirt (Nancy), grandchildren Amy, Ben, Matt (Michelle) and Hal, and great-grandchildren Jacob and Isabelle.<br/><br/>Harold was a third generation Arizonan. His grandfather, E. T. Ijams, came from Ohio and California to Tucson in 1880, was a businessman in Graham County, and served in the Arizona Territorial Legislature during 1904-05. His father, Sheldon, attended The University of Arizona and was instrumental in establishing some of the first telephone and electric power grid facilities in southeastern Arizona.<br/><br/>Harold was loved by all of his extended family and was appreciated for his great sense of humor, how to think through and solve problems, ability to repair almost anything and well-read knowledge of current events. A private family gathering in his memory is planned for the near future. "Goom-bye" Pop-Pop. Arrangements through Hudgel's Swan Funeral Home.<br/><br/>Published Arizona Daily Star; 22-Nov-2005

"When he was about 6 years old, he told me he had a lot of questions about different things, but (he) prayed hard and said it really helped."<br/><br/>Joshua Petree and Brittnay Swett, 19, of Hot Springs were supposed to be married Thursday, but life changed tragically Tuesday night.<br/><br/>The two were driving to a meeting when they were involved in an accident that killed five people, including Petree.<br/><br/>Caryn Petree said her son was supposed to do a reading from the Bible at the meeting and practiced reading it to Swett as she drove.<br/><br/>South Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Greg Ingemunson said Swett was driving a Nissan Maxima east on S.D. Highway 34 about seven miles east of Belle Fourche when she tried to pass another eastbound vehicle. In doing so, her vehicle collided head-on with a westbound Plymouth Breeze driven by James Casteel, 41, of Vale.<br/><br/>Casteel and his wife, Kristena Casteel, 37, were both killed. Also riding with them were Barry Austin, 42, of White Owl and Dorothy Iiams, 52, of Mills, Wyo. Austin and Iiams also were killed.<br/><br/>Northern Hills Squad Sgt. Kevin Burke of the South Dakota Highway Patrol was one of the first people on the scene of the accident. He said Thursday that Iiams and Kristena Casteel were in the back seat and were not wearing seat belts. Burke said he did not know if James Casteel, Austin and Petree were wearing seat belts.<br/><br/>Burke said all six people involved had to be extricated from the vehicles.<br/><br/>All but Swett were pronounced dead at the scene.<br/><br/>"It's a miracle she's coming out of this," Burke said of Swett.<br/><br/>Swett remains in serious condition at Rapid City Regional Hospital.<br/><br/>Her father, Tom Swett, said he believes the main reason she survived the wreck is she was wearing a seat belt.<br/><br/>"We preached that to her from the time she was little," he said. "Fortunately, she got it, or we probably wouldn't have her today."<br/><br/>He said Brittnay Swett was conscious immediately after the accident and tried to wake up Petree.<br/><br/>Tom Swett said one of the first people on the scene of the accident had held his daughter's hand. That person later contacted Tom Swett and said Brittnay Swett had talked about her wedding plans as they waited for help to arrive.<br/><br/>He said she and Petree had dated for a little more than a year and that she was living at a hotel in Belle Fourche until the wedding. Brittnay Swett and Petree had planned to make their home in Belle Fourche, where Petree's family lives.<br/><br/>Caryn Petree said her son was an outgoing person who valued family and religion.<br/><br/>"He never met a stranger," she said.<br/><br/>Joshua Petree had recently started his own construction business in Belle Fourche. Caryn Petree said he was looking forward to summer and the jobs he had lined up.<br/><br/>Tom Swett said Brittnay Swett is expected to have to stay in the hospital for a couple of weeks to monitor her injuries, which include a badly broken leg and broken arm. He said some bones from her foot were missing and that she underwent surgery for the injury.<br/><br/>"It's such a sad, sad situation," Tom Swett said. "We just feel so bad for the other families involved."<br/><br/>James and Kristena Casteel had been married in September 2004 and ranched near Vale. Austin worked on his family's ranch near White Owl. Iiams was a friend of Austin. More information about James and Kristena Casteel, Austin and Iiams was not available on Thursday.

Her soul was lifted to heaven by a gentle breeze. Her loved ones left behind, whom she deeply loved and enjoyed, were her husband, William H.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Linda’s Vibrant Life<br/><br/>A young lady with ties to the area died a day before Bette. Linda Smyda was only 39. My wife, Sharon,and I remember Linda from some 16 years ago when she moved to the Spokane area to be near her parents, Ken and Frieda Iiams. Her brother, Mike Iiams, and his family, also live in the area in Post Falls, Idaho.<br/><br/>Linda Iiams and her husband-to be James Smyda met as freshmen at Ambassador College in Big Sandy,Texas, in 1988. They graduated in 1992 and got married in December of 1994. Eventually they settled in Cedar Hill, Texas.<br/><br/>After her death, Linda’s last on the-job supervisor, Jim, sent his condolences. He effectively summarized her personality and approach to life: “She had such a pleasing and vibrant personality. She had such a vitality and favorable outlook on the job and life in general. Her smile was infectious,and she interacted well with everyone she came in contact with. She was such a pleasure to work with.”<br/><br/>One of Linda’s fellow employees also sent a note. “The last time she and I visited, I expressed appreciation to her for always being so upbeat and cheerful. Her response was, ‘I’m that way because I choose to be.’ Jim, you picked a winner in Linda.”<br/><br/>Yet Linda’s vibrant life came to anabrupt end just two and a half months after her doctor’s diagnosis of colon cancer, which had spread to her liver and other parts of her body.<br/><br/>When someone so vibrant is cutoff in the prime of life, it can be particularly disheartening.“O Death, where is your sting?”<br/><br/><br/>The United News (NewsLetter)<br/>News of The United Church of God, and International Association<br/>Vol 14, No 9; Nov 2009, page 21<br/>PO Box 541027<br/>Cincinnati, OH<br/>(513) 576-9796<br/><br/>www.ucg.org<br/><a href="https://ucgfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/collection/united-news-november-2008.pdf" target="_blank">https://ucgfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/collection/united-news-november-2008.pdf</a>

It just fell into place,” said <b>Larry Iams of Datil</b>, founder of the troupe. “I wasn’t expecting to get this good of a response.”<br/>After each performance Iams talks to the audience and enjoys fielding questions from kids.<br/>“We try to be as historically accurate as possible, while still be entertaining,” Iams said. “I never liked the Hollywood versions of the Old West, you know, where you have 50 rounds in your pistol and can hit something a mile away with a .45.”<br/>Iams said the drama in historical events is more compelling than their fictionalized accounts.<br/>“Things like shootouts, in reality, happened very fast and at close range,” he said. “We might add a little extra dialog for our actors, but the style of dress and the weapons are historically accurate.”<br/>Most of the rifles and pistols used in the re-enactments are replicas, but the cartridges are, of course, blanks.<br/>“Sometimes we have problems with [misfires] during the show, but that happened even in the Old West,” Iams said. “Normally I load all our blanks, but problems with ‘em come up. Maybe with the altitude.”<br/>Now he has to buy blanks from the same company that sells blanks to movie companies.<br/>“They can cost up to one dollar each. That can get quite expensive,” he said. “Our shows are free, but we do take donations from audience members.”<br/>Iams said the group now numbers a little over a dozen people.<br/>“They’re mostly from Datil and around that area, but we could use a few more. Everybody does it on a voluntary basis. Because they all share the same love of Old West history,” he said. <br/>Each member portrays a historical figure, and Iams is looking for three or four more men, and three or four more women.<br/>“Having their own firearms is a plus,” he said. “They need to have their own firearms. Using someone else’s gun is like wearing somebody else’s shoes or hat.<br/>“Me and Fred Ferguson have been supplying guns to those without guns so far.”<br/>Also needed is a period musician, he said.<br/>Iams has been part of Old West re-enactments for several years, after he worked as a wrangler in Colorado in the early 1990’s. “I started doing this in California,” he said. “Started in 1995 with the Fallbrook Outlaws in Fallbrook, California.”<br/>That group has earned several awards for staged gunfights and stunts.<br/>Iams said the next performance will be in Pie Town for the Pie Festival.<br/>Pictures: (top) Larry Iams displays his six shooter and gunbelt<br/>(bottom) One of the skits performed at Old Timers.

Cremation. Memorial services, summer 2011.(1/2)<br/>Copyright (c) 2011 The Billings Gazette<br/><br/><b>Adela Ranta Iams: Newspaper Obituary and Death Notice<br/>Billings Gazette, The (MT) - Sunday, January 2, 2011<br/>Deceased Name: Adela Ranta Iams<br/></b>Adela Ranta Iams was born in Deaconess Hospital in Billings, on April 3, 1936. There was a nasty snow storm between Red Lodge and Billings on that day and with the road only gravel it took her father several hours to reach the hospital in time. She spent the next nineteen years in Red Lodge having, as she described it," The happiest and most carefree days of my life." After graduating from high school she made the decision to move to Billings in search of a job.<br/><br/>She began working the day after her graduation for Mountain Bell as a switch board operator. She loved her job and during the next thirty-four years she kept pace with the advances of communication technology and became a manager of Operator Services. She retired in 1989 as one of AT&T's outstanding employees. During those early years on the job she successfully juggled her job with family. She married Jeffrie Iams in 1956 and together they had four children Jeffrie Iams Jr., (Eileen) of Kalispell, Mont., Joel Iams (Pat) of Payson, Ariz., Summer Davey (Keith) of Great Falls, Mont., and Stephanie Lodman (John) of Boise, Idaho. She loved her children with a passion. As an only child she delighted in the flurry of activities and opportunities she could provide for her children.<br/><br/>Adela was active in the Red Lodge Methodist Church as a youth and was a thirty year member of the First Methodist Church in Billings. Her firm belief in the hereafter ensured her a place in Heaven. Adela and Jeff resided in several states during their fifty-four years of marriage but she never gave up her home in Montana. She always said, "My roots branch from Billings to Red Lodge." Her retirement was filled with joyful trips to visit her four children, eleven grandchildren and two great grandchildren. She enjoyed cruises, reading good books and trips to Las Vegas and Deadwood. She had a wide circle of friends and loved to lunch with them. There was a special group saved for Fridays and she could not wait to see them to discuss the events of the week and share a glass of wine.<br/><br/>She is preceded in death by her mother Ellen Ranta; her father Arne Ranta; her niece Madola Mares; and her brother-in-law Mike (Concrete) Iams. In addition to her husband; children and grandchildren, she is survived by several cousins and an aunt.<br/><br/>She entered the kingdom of heaven on Dec. 30, 2010. Our family would like to express our gratitude to the nurses and caregivers at Riverstone Hospice. A special thanks to Shanda at The Billings Clinic. Cremation has taken place. A memorial service will be held on a warm sunny day in July. Michelotti-Sawyers is in charge of arrangements and remembrances may be left for the family at www.michelottisawyers.com.<br/>Adela IamsCopyright (c) 2011 The Billings Gazette

The number of arrests marks a “concerning and marked increase,” in the number of this type of arrest in the township, he said.<br/>“If these arrests had been spread out over the year, it probably would not have been as significant,” Batelli said. “But, we are starting to see a lot more heroin coming into Mahwah.”<br/>Batelli credits three factors with the increase of the drug – price, availability and potency. “Heroin is much less expensive than it used to be, and we’re finding that people are getting the drug in Paterson. So instead of having to go over the bridge or tunnel to get to New York, which typically have large a police presence, the drug can be more easily acquired in NJ." The “purity level” of the drug is also on the rise, he said,<br/>All but one of the arrests were made during or after motor vehicle stops. “We have always had the philosophy of looking beyond the traffic ticket during a stop, so there are a lot of ways our officers are trained in to look of signs of heroin use in cars that are being pulled over.”<br/>Batelli also said the PD believes heroin has been the true culprit behind several recent residential burglaries. “We believe that some of the money taken during home invasions during the past few weeks has gone to supporting a heroin addiction.”<br/>Batelli explained the following arrests made over the past five weeks:<br/>A Mahwah resident was arrested on possession charges after police were called to a Route 17 office building, where the woman was passed out in the stairwell, Batelli said. She was reportedly a friend of someone who works in the building, he said.<br/>Christopher Antoniou, 36, Roscoe, New York was arrested by Officers Iorio and Blondin for possession of heroin, Batelli said. The arrest came during a motor vehicle stop when officers observed both physical and behavioral symptoms of narcotic use, he said. During the motor vehicle stop and a search of the vehicle, two bricks of heroin were located in the vehicle. Each brick contained approximately 50 waxed paper folds of the drug, Batelli said.<br/>Jessica Kilduff, 23, was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia, Batelli said. Lucas Sacher, 26, was also charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia, he said. According to Batelli, Officer Ryan Hill found a bundle of 10 wax paper folds of heroin and hypodermic needles in their car during a motor vehicle stop, Batelli said.<br/>Jeison Ayala of Newburgh, New York was arrested by Officers Richard Albro and Stacy Conley for possession of heroin and possession of a prohibited weapon/device, Batelli said. Ayala was allegedly found with nine wax folds believed to be heroin in the center console of his vehicle and a large butterfly knife, he said.<br/>Lisa Buono, 39, of Hurley, NY, was arrested after police allegedly found a brick of heroin and several hypodermic needles, methadone pills and paraphernalia used in the ingestion of heroin in her car, Batelli said. Buono was charged with possession of a hypodermic needle, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of heroin, he said. Her boyfriend Louis Little, 41, of West Hurley, New York was charged with possession of heroin, possession of methadone and possession of a hypodermic needle. Mahwah K9 Officer Robert Rapp, and dog Dome, made the arrests after a traffic stop.<br/><b>Daniel Iams, 26, of Monroe, NY, was charged with possession of heroin, possession of suboxone, possession of hypodermic needles, possession of drug paraphernalia and given numerous motor vehicle summonses after police allegedly found heroin in his car during a traffic stop, Batelli said. As a result of a continued investigation by Investigator Michael Grassi, additional items found in the vehicle resulted in Iams being charged with receiving stolen property and that information was turned over to Rockland County officials.<br/></b>Batelli called the number of arrests a “disturbing trend. We have this perception that heroin addicts are on street corners in big cities, but that is not what we are seeing now. These people live in the suburbs,” he said.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">BLOOMINGTON — The Christmas that Connie and Scott Ijams had planned instead will be filled with the emotional and physical scars left after two dogs attacked the couple last week, but both want to thank the unknown man whose actions may have saved their lives.<br/>Connie Ijams, 45, remains in OSF St. Joseph Medical Center in Bloomington, following surgery for wounds to her arms. Her husband, Scott, 46, was injured trying to save her.<br/>“We were just trying to make some money for Christmas,” Connie Ijams told The Pantagraph. “But I will never take a job like that again. I was afraid for my life.”<br/>The Ijams were delivering phone books about 12:55 p.m. Wednesday in the 1200 block of Orchard Road when a large pit bull pushed through an apartment door and started to attack Connie as she approached the doorstep. Scott was attacked when he tried to pull the dog away.<br/>“I’ve got mostly puncture wounds, but nothing as serious as hers,” said Scott Ijams, explaining his wife was in critical condition until a recent upgrade. “I was just trying to beat the dog off as best I could. It was so chaotic and everything was happening so fast. Neither one of us remember much about the specific details after it happened.”<br/>At some point, a man in a car saw the commotion and began honking the horn before backing the dogs against a wall. That allowed police and emergency workers to treat the Ijams.<br/>“We don’t know who he was,” Scott Ijams said. “We don’t have a name or anything, but we would love to find out who it was and thank him. I’m not sure what would have happened if he wasn’t there, but he did what he had to do to save us.”<br/>The dogs’ owner, whose name has not been made public, could not be reached for comment. The dogs remain housed by McLean County Animal Control.<br/>The investigation<br/>Police are still investigating the attack, said Bloomington Police spokesman Dave White. Charges could be filed after a full review has been completed.<br/>Under a 2006 Bloomington city ordinance, all dog and cat owners must register their pets with animal control. If they fail to do so, their pets could be seized.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">BLOOMINGTON — The Christmas that Connie and Scott Ijams had planned instead will be filled with the emotional and physical scars left after two dogs attacked the couple last week, but both want to thank the unknown man whose actions may have saved their lives.<br/>Connie Ijams, 45, remains in OSF St. Joseph Medical Center in Bloomington, following surgery for wounds to her arms. Her husband, Scott, 46, was injured trying to save her.<br/>“We were just trying to make some money for Christmas,” Connie Ijams told The Pantagraph. “But I will never take a job like that again. I was afraid for my life.”<br/>The Ijams were delivering phone books about 12:55 p.m. Wednesday in the 1200 block of Orchard Road when a large pit bull pushed through an apartment door and started to attack Connie as she approached the doorstep. Scott was attacked when he tried to pull the dog away.<br/>“I’ve got mostly puncture wounds, but nothing as serious as hers,” said Scott Ijams, explaining his wife was in critical condition until a recent upgrade. “I was just trying to beat the dog off as best I could. It was so chaotic and everything was happening so fast. Neither one of us remember much about the specific details after it happened.”<br/>At some point, a man in a car saw the commotion and began honking the horn before backing the dogs against a wall. That allowed police and emergency workers to treat the Ijams.<br/>“We don’t know who he was,” Scott Ijams said. “We don’t have a name or anything, but we would love to find out who it was and thank him. I’m not sure what would have happened if he wasn’t there, but he did what he had to do to save us.”<br/>The dogs’ owner, whose name has not been made public, could not be reached for comment. The dogs remain housed by McLean County Animal Control.<br/>The investigation<br/>Police are still investigating the attack, said Bloomington Police spokesman Dave White. Charges could be filed after a full review has been completed.<br/>Under a 2006 Bloomington city ordinance, all dog and cat owners must register their pets with animal control. If they fail to do so, their pets could be seized. White said the adult dog was registered but could still be seized.<br/>“We’ll seize any dog if it attacks and breaks the skin and it’s the possibility that someone could have contracted a disease, rabies or whatever,” White said. He said the younger dog, about three years old, was not registered.<br/>Since 2006, the city has issued a total of 110 tickets for failure to register, according to city attorney Todd Greenburg.

Scott Ijams came to her rescue, but the dog then turned on him.<br/>“I was covered in mud and blood and a police officer told me I looked like I needed a long shower,” he said. “But I didn’t care. I just had to get that dog off of her.”<br/>A man across the street saw the commotion and began honking his horn and driving his vehicle toward the scene.

She is scheduled for arraignment on March 8 in circuit court.<br/>The Ijams are hoping restitution is applied to any conviction.<br/>Police and rescue personnel arrived on the scene and realized that Scott Ijams had suffered cuts to his arms, but Connie Ijams had lost a lot of blood. Her arms were torn up and she was in pain.<br/>“It was scary,” Connie Ijams said. “Just real scary.”<br/>She and her husband were taken to OSF St. Joseph Medical Center. Connie underwent four hours of surgery as doctors worked to repair injuries to her damaged skin, arm tissues and tendons. By the time she was sewn up, doctors counted more than 200 stitches.<br/>She spent 10 days in the hospital and had a second surgery. The scars on her arms are still visible, and she suffered nerve damage in her arms.<br/>“The doctor said that it is a good thing I have a little meat on my arms or I might have been in serious trouble,” she said.<br/>Understandably, the attack changed her life.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/painful-memory-arm-injuries-costs-linger-after-dog-attack/article_1e526f9a-8152-11e2-9bf7-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">https://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/painful-memory-arm-injuries-costs-linger-after-dog-attack/article_1e526f9a-8152-11e2-9bf7-0019bb2963f4.html</a>

If they fail to do so, their pets can be seized.<br/>The adult dog was registered, but it was taken because of the brutality of the attack.<br/>It was later euthanized, and two weeks ago Doss was charged with reckless conduct with the possibility of causing great bodily harm, a Class 4 felony. She is scheduled for arraignment on March 8 in circuit court.<br/>The Ijams are hoping restitution is applied to any conviction.<br/>Police and rescue personnel arrived on the scene and realized that Scott Ijams had suffered cuts to his arms, but Connie Ijams had lost a lot of blood. Her arms were torn up and she was in pain.<br/>“It was scary,” Connie Ijams said. “Just real scary.”<br/>She and her husband were taken to OSF St. Joseph Medical Center. Connie underwent four hours of surgery as doctors worked to repair injuries to her damaged skin, arm tissues and tendons. By the time she was sewn up, doctors counted more than 200 stitches.<br/>She spent 10 days in the hospital and had a second surgery. The scars on her arms are still visible, and she suffered nerve damage in her arms.<br/>“The doctor said that it is a good thing I have a little meat on my arms or I might have been in serious trouble,” she said.<br/>Understandably, the attack changed her life.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/painful-memory-arm-injuries-costs-linger-after-dog-attack/article_1e526f9a-8152-11e2-9bf7-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">https://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/painful-memory-arm-injuries-costs-linger-after-dog-attack/article_1e526f9a-8152-11e2-9bf7-0019bb2963f4.html</a>

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Ivan Lorraine Fox, passed away peacefully surrounded by his family on March 10th in Seattle, WA. Born in Prosser, WA Nov. 14th 1918, Ivan was the 2nd eldest of eight children born of William and Dolly Fox.<br/><br/>He labored in the 3 C's after high school, rode a steamship to Kodiak in 1941 to find work. In 1943 he returned to Seattle and volunteered for the Navy because the war was on. He served his country with distinction in the Merchant Marines delivering fuel to the troops in the South Pacific. He signed up for tanker duty on a floating bomb because they were paying an extra $10 a month and it allowed him to send more home to his mother and siblings.<br/><br/>In 1944 he returned to Kodiak and found work on a fishing boat rowing a seine skiff before they had motors. The summers of 1945-46 he skippered a wooden cannery tender, the San Antonio. The fall of 1946 he took the job of cannery book keeper at San Juan Fishing and Packing Co; thus beginning his illustrious career in the salmon processing industry.<br/><br/>Ivan met Lillian "Jody" Joten in Ballard. They were married in Oct. of 1951 and were constant companions until the end. Over his 50 year career in the seafood industry with San Juan, NEFCO, Sea-Alaska, Ocean Beauty, Nelbro Packing, and Alaska General Seafood's he was responsible for salmon price negotiations and fleet management across the state of Alaska.<br/><br/>It is commonly said in Kodiak, that Ivan Fox invented salmon. He was fondly known as Ivan Fish of The New England Fox Company (NEFCO) where he was the VP of Operations and superintendent of 6 processing plants in Alaska. He loved his work in the fishing industry so much he retired 3 times from various fish processing firms in Alaska before it finally stuck.<br/><br/>From his home base in Uganik Bay he witnessed the rise and fall of Salmon Traps. He was there when Alaska became the 49th state in the union and helped build the first salmon seine fleet and set gill net fleets on the Island before statehood. He and Jody founded their own business in Seattle in 1964, MER Equipment, to support the fishing fleet in Alaska.<br/><br/>Ivan was known as a tough negotiator but always respected for his fair bargaining practice. He mentored many of the top seafood plant managers in the state today and was instrumental in lending a helping hand to some of the top fishermen in the state getting them started in the business. He will be sorely missed by the processing community and the salmon fishing fleet alike.<br/><br/>Ivan had a great love of family, cooking, gardening, travel, and Beagles. He was successful in business, never compromising his integrity for advantage. His word was his bond, his handshake sealed many a million dollar contract over a bar napkin. He was generous to a fault, more comfortable with the joy of giving than receiving. Ivan was always game for a friendly wager, one of his many ways of showing affection. He was a compassionate man with a quick wit and uncanny memory for all the people and events that made up his long and illustrious career. He was truly a legend in his time.<br/><br/>He is survived by his wife and love of 61 years, Jody Fox, his three children Christy (Robert) Allen, Mike (fiance; Judy Simon) & Steve Fox, grandchildren Tyler (Rachel) Allen, Ashley Allen, Chelsea, Savannah, Sean Fox, great grandchildren Ivan & Evelyn Allen, his youngest brother Mel Fox, many "adopted" sons and daughters, and Beagle Molly. He will be missed by all who knew and loved him. At Ivan's request, in lieu of flowers, please make a donation to your local Salvation Army or the Seattle Fisherman's Memorial in his name.<br/><br/>A memorial to celebrate Ivan's life will be held on April 4th, 3:00-6:00 p.m. at Ray's Boathouse.<br/>Published in The Seattle Times from Mar. 16 to Mar. 17, 2013 - See more at: <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/seattletimes/obituary.aspx?pid=163657691#sthash.0vmCQkJp.dpuf" target="_blank">http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/seattletimes/obituary.aspx?pid=163657691#sthash.0vmCQkJp.dpuf</a>

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">HEATHER IJAMES: A dozen years of marriage, some a cracked egg<br/>BY HEATHER IJAMES Contributing columnist<br/><br/><br/><br/>I always reflect on my marriage at the end of May because it's anniversary time. Twelve years now. A dozen. That's like one egg for each year, and I suppose there are some cracked eggs in the bunch. This year, however, the egg is looking pretty good. I've been trying to put together some quantifiable reasons why this year has been better than others, and this is what I've come up with so far:<br/><br/>I've met a lot of difficult people this year, and it makes much of my husband's antics pale in comparison. I'm sort of saying this tongue in cheek, but then again, I'm not. I highly recommend having to deal with rough people on a somewhat habitual basis because instead of wanting to come home and bark at your spouse for who knows what, you might just want to cuddle up and say, "Hold me, Seymour." I know that's what I've been doing of late. Not so strangely, my husband prefers this, rather than going on, ad nauseam, about how he's making the foot of our bed his impromptu second closet for jeans.<br/><br/>I've also assumed that when people say marriage is an equal partnership, it includes sharing the annoyances equally, too. This matters because -- and I don't want anyone getting get mad at me for saying this -- wives are preternaturally less annoying than husbands. This is fact. (Among other women, of course.) The husband is the one who does far more annoying things, and the wife is the one who gets far more annoyed.<br/><br/>I've decided to equalize the distribution of annoyance. Take that impromptu second closet my husband is building at the foot of our bed, for example. It bothers me, but instead of getting worked up about it, I try to visualize what would annoy him in return. He doesn't like it when I go through a bunch of cups in the course of a day and then leave them out. Guess how many cups are on the counter by nightfall? As many as it takes.<br/><br/>And then, presto, annoyances are equalized and we laugh about it. Or, come to blows about dirty cups and thrown-about jeans, but mainly, we laugh because we think being stupidly clever is more fun than being annoyed.<br/><br/>Lastly, and I think most significantly, I've learned to get over myself. Somehow -- in those cracked egg years -- I managed to convince myself I had inalienable rights within marriage. Seriously, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard and I'm the one who said it. How do two people, coming together to form a union, a partnership, each bear unchallengeable rights? That's not a marriage. Heck, those rights don't even exist in my house when someone wants to use the bathroom.<br/><br/>Charles really didn't have to get over himself as much as I did. He's more of a people pleaser, whereas I'm more of a ... um ... people enrager.<br/><br/>Anyway, the more I got over myself, the more I realized it wasn't as difficult to get along with others, especially the guy I married. I'm not suggesting being a doormat, I'm saying that sometimes (most of the time) when you know who you are, you don't have to defend your frontiers as much as you think you do. For example, does the fact that Charles loves the NBA playoffs more than me during the month of May and some of June mean that he doesn't love me at all? No! It means I need to accidentally on purpose forget to pay the cable bill starting in March.<br/><br/>Or, it means that he really likes basketball and I can give him that time of inattentiveness as a gift to myself, in that it's much easier to sneak in my unauthorized shoe purchases right under his nose.<br/><br/>And that's that. In all seriousness, I think after 12 years, Charles and I are starting to get the hang of this thing. Perhaps it really does have something to do with each of us putting ourselves second in the marriage, as well as realizing that if love is present, perfection doesn't have to be. Oh, and lots of laughter. Otherwise, you'll be crying.<br/><br/>-- Heather Ijames is one of three community columnists whose work appears here every Saturday.

They had four children: William, Agnes, Sherman and Elton. He accepted the Lord and was baptized at Miracle Temple Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, Apostolic Faith. He was a devoted husband and father and loved to be in the company of his relatives and friends. He loved to listen to quartet music and was an avid hunter and fisherman. He was employed with Calvert County Public Schools for 28 years of faithful and dedicated service before he retired with full disability, due to his illness. He was not a very outgoing person. However, he was a friend to everyone who came into his presence. During his illness, when the family came to visit him, there was not a time in which he did not request prayer as he sat in his chair in the family’s living room. They would hold hands, and he would have a big smile on his face and would say in a loud voice, “Thank God for my time,” a song was sung, a scripture was read and then there was a final dismissal. He will be missed by his devoted wife, who sacrificed much of her time caring for him.<br/>He was preceded in death by his sisters, Eva Butler and Isabelle White.<br/>He is survived by his wife, Clara Parran Ijams; four children, William E. Smith, Agnes Gross, Sherman Ijams and Elton Ijams; 10 grandchildren; son-in-law, Kenneth Gross; daughter-in-law, Maxine Ijams; four sisters, Emma Gantt, Evelyn Gross, Bernice Ijams and Ethel Janey; brother, Charles and his wife, Lena Mae; brothers-in-law, Wilson Parran and his wife, Debbie, Benjamin Parran and Abraham Gantt; and a host of nieces, nephews and friends.<br/>Funeral service was held May 31 at Sewell Funeral Home in Prince Frederick, with the Rev. William E. Smith officiating.<br/>Interment was at Chesapeake Highlands Memorial Gardens in Port Republic.<br/>Pallbearers were men from the Church of God in Lothian. Honorary pallbearers were William E. Smith Jr. and Kevin Jones.

Born June 1, 1921, Mr. Bickley was the son of Ervin Felton Bickley and Hannah Elizabeth Davis. Mr. Bickley was a graduate of Olney High School, Philadelphia, PA and of Drexel University, College of Engineering, Class of 1942 with a B.S. in Chemical Engineerin g. While at Drexel, he was member of The American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Interfraternity Council, Blue Key, Scabbard and Blade. In addition he was exchange editor of THE DREXERD and played Varsity Football. Later in life, Mr. Bickley served as a member of Drexel's Board of Trustees from 1977 - 1992 and remained a Trustee Emeritus until his death.<br/><br/>Mr. Bickley served as a First Lieutenant during World War II, primarily in the Pacific Theatre, as a Statistical Control Officer in the headquarters of General Douglas Macarthur in both Manila and Tokyo. He was an "expert" marksman, the highest army ranking. In addition to other decorations and citations, Mr. Bickley earned recognition for service during the Philippine liberation. While in Japan, Lt. Bickley was elected President of the Nippon Dragons Club in Tokyo, which was founded by thirteen Drexel men, all army officers. <br/><br/>In 1992, the Drexel 100, the University's alumni hall of fame was launched as part of the celebration surrounding Drexel's 100th Anniversary. Mr. Bickley was acknowledged as one of Drexel's distinguished alums. Every two years the Drexel community bestows this highest level of alumni recognition on a small select group of graduates whose lifetime achievements have brought great honour to Drexel University. <br/><br/>From 1969 - 1999, Mr. Bickley was Chairman of the Board and C.E.O. of New England Envelope Manufacturing Company, Worcester, MA which was sold to WESTVACO upon his retirement. Previously, Mr. Bickley worked at Pa ckaging Corporation of America, serving as President of their subsidiary Coates Board and Carton Company and later as Vice President at the parent company. Prior to that, he worked at International Paper Corporation, Container Corporation of America, and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.

In New Canaan, CT, Mr. Bickley was the Co-Founder and President of the Citizens Continuing Committee on Conservation from 1966-1980. He chaired the New Canaan Bicentennial Committee from 1972-1976 and was responsible for the biggest 4th of July celebration to date in New Canaan, which drew an estimated 14000 people and credited for the start of the "Family Fourth" celebration in New Canaan which in 1980 became an annual event. Mr. Bickey was at one time a Trustee of the Congregational Church in New Canaan and taught Sunday school there. In addition, Mr. Bickley served on the board of the New Canaan Historical Society until recently. <br/><br/>Mr. Bickley was known for his sense of humour, "tough but fair" demeanor, fondness for his childhood and college adventures in Ocean City, NJ and at Drexel respectively and for his love of ice cream and dark chocolate. He was a good paddle tennis player in his younger years, and also enjoyed squash, tennis, golf, and was a formidable Bridge player. He was an avid reader, favoring world history and who-done-its. A member of the Pennsylvania Society Sons of the Revolution, he had great interest in family history and in genealogy. Mr. Bickley traced his own family back several hundred years, a feat of which he was most proud as this was accomplished through good persistent research well before the computer age. It was this love of history, family, and heritage which led him to travel along with his wife Edith to Singapore, to visit the Kampong Kapor Methodist Church (Bishop Bickley Memorial) which honored his grandfather, Bishop George Harvey Bickley, who was an American Bishop of the Methodist Church elected in 1920 and who served there as a missionary until 1924. The Bickleys were pleased to be present during the celebration of the 100th Anniversary in 1994. <br/><br/>Mr. Bickley is survived by his wife of 54 years, Edith Mitchell Bickley of Redding, CT, daughters Dr. Lynn Scott Bickley (Dr. Randolph B. Schiffer), of Santa Fe, NM, Ann Felton Bickley, of Reno, NV, and Jean Mitchell Bickley, of Stamford, CT along with five Grandsons and two great grandchildren. <br/><br/>In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to: <br/>David J.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">A former Tulsa County public defender and prosecutor was put on probation this week for DUI and eluding crimes.<br/><br/>Clayton D. Ijams, 44, pleaded guilty to those two misdemeanors and no contest to a misdemeanor offense of obstruction.<br/><br/>In accordance with a plea deal, Special Judge Bill Hiddle imposed a one-year suspended sentence for the DUI, which means Ijams was convicted on that count. The judge deferred sentencing for 18 months on the other two charges, which means Ijams can avoid convictions on those counts.<br/><br/>A burglary count was dismissed previously.<br/><br/>Ijams was accused of breaking into his ex-wife’s house in April 2013 and fleeing when police arrived, according to his arrest report. At the time, he was an assistant public defender, but he no longer is employed in that office.<br/><br/>Ijams also is a former Tulsa County assistant district attorney.<br/><br/>As conditions of his probation, he must serve seven weekends in the Tulsa Jail and perform 80 hours of public service work.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Kelly Ann Ravert, age 58, of Lander, fought her courageous battle with cancer until May 9, 2016. There will be a celebration of her life on July 9, 2016 at 11 am, at the Chapel of Mount Hope, Hudson's Funeral Home, in Lander.<br/><br/>Kelly was born on August 27, 1957 to Edward and Hilda (Iiams) McKinney in Lander, Wyoming. She was the youngest of three children. She grew up on the family ranch and attended schools in Lander. Shortly after starting kindergarten, Kelly tried to quit school so she could go back to the ranch and help her Grandpa Earl. She was a member of a bowling league and a dart league in her earlier years and later became a member of the VFW Women's Auxiliary.<br/><br/>Kelly loved keeping track of her grandbabies activities and accomplishments and looked forward to the phone calls to hear all about them. Her favorite time spent was when her family and friends visited. Kelly spent many hours crocheting, making blankets to either give away or keep at home. Having worked at Weekly's Interiors for many years, she learned how to make ceramics and was able to help teach others as well. She also made many crafty items from macrame, beadwork, and woodburnings. Her favorite time of the year was summer when she could watch the different types of birds visit her backyard. She especially loved it when the hummingbirds (being her favorite) showed up so she could watch them out her dining room window. Kelly was an animal lover from a young age and held a special place in her heart for her dogs Buddy, Daisy, and Spook. She liked being outdoors doing anything from gardening, arrowhead hunting, looking for antique bottles, camping, hunting, and fishing. She was happy when football season arrived so she could cheer for her Denver Broncos. Her wit, sense of humor, and especially her caring heart will be greatly missed.<br/><br/>Kelly is survived by her husband of 24 years, Mike Ravert of Lander; daughter, Mandy Thomas and husband Terry, and grandchildren Jaysie, Cole, and Ellie of Wright; son, Jason Stevens and granddaughter Cameah of Gillette; son, Ben Ravert and wife Tiffany, and granddaughters Anzlie, Grayce, Emma, and Paysen of Stafford, Oregon; brother Tim McKinney and wife Roseanne of Lander; father and mother-in-law Dean and Dolores Ravert, sister-in-law Cheryl Ravert, and brother-in-law Wade Ravert and family, all of Casper; several nieces, nephews, cousins, and dear friends.<br/><br/>Kelly was preceded in death by her parents; grandparents Earl and Dottie McKinney, and Jim and Beulah Iiams; sister Marilynn Adams; and nephew Todd McKinney.<br/><br/>In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Help for Health, Tough Enough to Help Cancer Fund, in Riverton, Wyoming.<br/>~ www.HudsonsFuneralHome.com<br/> <br/><br/>Burial:<br/>Unknown

However, the EMS chief was not present Wednesday and has not notified the board herself of any plans to resign.   <br/>Mrs. Hendel made the motion to dismiss Mr. Iiams following a series of questions over the ambulance district’s financial reports that included the whereabouts of approximately $15,000 in check payments to the agency that were not deposited and were unaccounted for at least three weeks.

She enjoyed stamp collecting and mountain climbing books, interests that continued for the rest of her life. Shirley graduated from Goldendale High School in 1945 and went to Central Washington College, majoring in education. She graduated in 1949 and received her master's degree in library science at the University of Washington in 1950. She married Robert Elton lams in 1953. They both worked at Tacoma Public Library, later moving to Camas, Wash, where Shirley taught school. Eventually they moved to Seattle where Bob and Shirley both worked for the Seattle Public Library for 25 years. They loved their cats, their neighbor's dog Lily (whom they would dog-sit during the day), and enjoyed travelling together. Bob died in 2000, and she missed him very much. Shirley enjoyed daily phone calls from her nephew Larry and friends Shirley and Emily. She loved roses and dahlias, waltzes and marching bands. Her favorite foods were tomatoes and chocolate, in that order. Shirley died on October 6, 2016. Her friends, family, nurses, and caregivers will miss her.<br/><br/>Goldendale Sentinel<br/>Goldendale, Washington<br/><a href="http://www.goldendalesentinel.com/story/2016/12/14/obituaries/shirley-ann-iams/8321.html" target="_blank">http://www.goldendalesentinel.com/story/2016/12/14/obituaries/shirley-ann-iams/8321.html</a><br/>December 14, 2016 | Vol. 137, No. 50

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote"><b>Town of Gabriella takes visitors to the Old West<br/></b>By Scott Turner / El Defensor Chieftain Editor<br/>Sunday, August 13th, 2017 at 12:02am<br/><br/>A trip to the Town of Gabriella can be a step back in time.<br/><br/>That was the case for the Romine family from Quemado with relatives in town from Texas.<br/><br/>“This is amazing,” Brian Romine said after his family toured the town with its saloon, dance hall, newspaper office, barber shop, courthouse, hotel, gallows and stagecoach stop. “It makes you feel like you’re in that time period.”<br/><br/>The gallows is conveniently located next to the Town of Gabriella courthouse.<br/>“It makes you wish the world was a little more like this,” said Kim Pollak of the peaceful setting of the town south of Datil that is the brainchild of Larry Iams.<br/><br/>She was in town visiting family from Farmersville, Texas, not far from Dallas.<br/><br/>The town is the result of work by Iams and friend Sal Zagra. It’s taken them about seven years to construct the town on a 128-acre spread of Highway 12.<br/><br/>“I’ve been wanting to do this for about 40 years,” Iams said.<br/><br/>Iams said he has had a fascination with western history dating back to his childhood days.<br/><br/>He and his wife, Janet “Missy” Iams, became involved in gunfighter groups.<br/><br/>They started participating in shows in Catron County, which included building sets. Zagra saw one of the shows and decided to become involved.<br/><br/>They built sets they transported to events in Quemado, the Pie Festival in Pie Town, the Old Timers Reunion in Magdalena and Octoberfest in Socorro.<br/><br/>The rough roads on the way to those events took its toll on the sets, which ended up leading them to bring the sets to the current site of the town so they can rehearse.<br/><br/>“I said the heck with it, I’m going to start a town,” Iams said. “That’s how this all got started.”<br/><br/>In all there are about 22 buildings including a post office, leather worker, marshal’s office with jail, grocery store, a shooting iron shop and a log cabin at the end of the street that was built in the 1930s.<br/><br/>It is a work in progress. They are trying for an authentic look in every building.<br/><br/>Like many others who are committed to keep American history of the west alive, Iams strives to stay as close to what it was like in the 1800s, even to the extent of finding period correct wallpaper and the acquisition of a fully-functional historical barber chair from Tombstone, Ariz., for the barbershop.<br/><br/>That isn’t the only connection to Tombstone. There is an area of the town where a re-enactment of the Gunfight at the O.K Corral is being constructed. Iams plays Ike Clanton in the re-enactment of the famous event involving Wyatt Earp, his brothers and Doc Holliday.<br/><br/>Iams said, however, that the town isn’t modeled after any town in particular. He said it was more modeled after Kansas cowtowns.<br/><br/>The first event held at the town was a Fourth of July event. There was a family in the community that had never been to a Fourth of July parade.<br/><br/>“We decided to have a potluck, a band and a parade just for the community,” Iams said.<br/><br/>Word spread initially through word-of-mouth. An Albuquerque television station did a feature story on the town. Iams said the television crew spent more than three hours filming around the town.<br/><br/>“That blew doors wide open,” Iams said. “We had people call from Arizona and Texas.”<br/><br/>He was also contacted by a gunfight group from El Paso. It was a branch of the Salt River Regulators out of Arizona. The group wanted to come up for gunfights and shows.<br/><br/>The town hosted an open house last September that featured four different gunfight groups. It had vendors and a band. It was a one-day event that drew about 300 people.<br/><br/>The town is open on weekends from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and hosts gunfight groups from Albuquerque, El Paso and Arizona.<br/><br/>People are welcome to visit during the week, but Iams prefers they make reservations.<br/><br/>Check the town’s Facebook page, Town Of Gabriella, for updates on upcoming events. Reservations can be made through messaging the Facebook page.

After all, her adoption 21 years ago was a blessing to both a Colorado and an Ottumwa family.<br/>Iiams, 21, was back in town this week to celebrate Thanksgiving and visit family. Tony Yencsik helped arrange the private adoption.<br/>“I was born here. Uncle Tony found me and my [adoptive] mom was the first one to hold me.”<br/>She’s met her birth mother, and keeps in touch via Facebook. But she only calls Nancy and Mike Iiams her mom and dad. Nancy is Tony’s sister; she wanted a baby so much, but was unable to have one of her own. Yencsik put the word among friends and loved ones; Nancy is ready to be a mother.<br/>A 13-year-old child in Ottumwa was not ready to be a mother.<br/>“Our dear friend’s daughter was pregnant, and their faith [meant] the girl would carry the baby,” said Yencsik. “Our friend needed help. My sister needed help. I was ready to be an uncle.”<br/>Here in Ottumwa, he excitedly called his sister at her home in Colorado.<br/>“I told her she had to call our friend Rose … right now,” said Yencsik.<br/>Private adoption paperwork was begun. The girl was 14 when she gave birth. Medical needs leading up to and including the birth were paid for by the Colorado couple.<br/>“The baby was born at Ottumwa Regional Health Center,” Yencsik said. “She came one month early. But she was fine, very healthy. This was a miracle.”<br/>Nancy was the first to hold her. And from the beginning, she was open with Krissy about the adoption. Krissy has heard a lot of the stories about the adventure.<br/>“Mom had to learn to take care of me,” Krissy said Friday. “She stayed about a week in the hospital.”<br/>She learned to feed, change and bathe her new daughter. One story says they were required by law to remain in Iowa for 30 days. The adoption paperwork moved between Ottumwa and Denver. Uncle Tony saw his sister and baby Krissy every day. When Nancy, her husband Mike and Krissy went to Colorado, Nancy’s Ottumwa family were soon there to visit. It would be more than a decade, however, before Krissy would meet her biological mother.<br/>That didn’t keep her from reciprocal visits to see Uncle Tony and family in Iowa, which is why she feels her Ottumwa roots.<br/>“I spent weeks at a time out here,” she said. “I was here at least once a year. We had a lot of fun with T-bone [Yencsik] and his garden; he has a forest behind his house.”<br/>For years, he owned Tony’s Flowers. He’d let the kids decorate the shop, arrange flowers and even wait on customers. It was Krissy along with her sister, Julia. Now 18, Julia had been adopted in very different circumstances.<br/>“She’s in her first year of college,” Krissy said.<br/>Uncle Tony said he, Julia and Krissy are all close. The girls’ lives, now in Littleton, Colorado, has been what Krissy calls “pretty normal.”<br/>They went to school, did activities after classes and stayed busy during the summer. Krissy battled and learned to work through a learning disability. She’s now in college studying business technology management.<br/>“I’ve always known I’m adopted. I’ve asked myself the ‘what-if’ questions. Wondered about my background,” said Krissy. “I’ve realized family is more about who you choose to let in your life than about blood. Not by blood — by choice.”<br/>Courier staff writer Mark Newman is at MNewman@OttumwaCourier.com or on Twitter @CourierMark. Editor’s note: Tony Yencsik is currently employed by the Ottumwa Courier.

Her father, William P. Ijams, was hired to supervise the Indianapolis Belt Railroad, and became the railroad president in 1883. He improved the nearly 1,000 acres of Warren Park, a farm on the current site of Honey Creek Square Mall. He was instrumental in the creation of the Four-Cornered Track and organized the American Trotting Association. In 1889, Ijams’ syndicate bought Axtell, a world record-setting stallion and hired a trainer for Warren Park’s 100-horse stable. He purchased Indiana Steel Company and with 16 investors incorporated the Terre Haute House. The family maintained a home at 400 North 7th Street and owned a ranch in Wyoming. Alice married Richard W. Benbridge, a 1906 Rose Polytechnic Institute graduate and one of the stakeholders in the Benbridge Foundry.<br/>Alice Ijams Benbridge was the only daughter of William and Sallie (Warren) Ijams. The couple also had two sons: Warren (a 1903 Rose Poly graduate) and Burch (a Yale University graduate). Alice, also a college graduate, had attended Bryn Mawr, a prestigious women’s liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. When Alice died in 1976 (at the age of 92) she had a considerable collection of couture clothing. Her clothing, donated by her nephew, has become known as the Ijams collection and represents a broad range of time periods and styles.<br/>This week’s historical treasure is a dress that would have been worn for entertaining or attending an evening soirée. This dress, made specifically for Alice, is a black satin evening gown with an elegant embroidered beadwork bodice. The net sleeves have small velvet caps and are decorated with jet beadwork and rhinestones. The empire waistline is accentuated with a black velvet sash and bow. The softly draped skirt, also decorated with jet beadwork and beaded fringe, is cut longer in the back to create a train which is weighted to maintain its shape.<br/>This dress is an excellent example of the change in women’s clothing that began around 1908. The S-curve shape that had been created with corsets and bustles was replaced with a straighter and more natural silhouette. Corsets, which had been used to constrict the waist to the smallest possible measurement, were now designed for spine and abdomen support to highlight the natural shape of the female body. Ruffles and frills were replaced with panel insets and beadwork. While it may seem elaborate today, this dress was part of a movement toward a simpler style. This style would continue to develop into the boyish, straight shapes popular in the 1920s. You can see this beautiful dress on display in the Dress Shoppe on the second floor of the Vigo County Historical Museum.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">A writer, who was passionate about antiques and auctions and documenting Philadelphia society, died peacefully in his sleep on November 8, 2017. He was 79 and had been in a period of decline since undergoing heart surgery a year earlier. Mr. Iams was born on March 18, 1938, in Pittsburgh, Pa., to Samuel and Dorothy Iams. He came to St. Paul’s School as a Third Former in the fall of 1951. He was a member of the Library Association, the Cadmean/Concordian Literary Society, and the Debate Team. He wrote for Horae Scholasticae and The Pelican, rowed with Shattuck, and competed for Delphian in cross country, football, and hockey.<br/><br/>Mr. Iams attended Princeton, where he edited the Princeton Tiger, the University’s humor magazine. He graduated in 1959, was recruited by the U.S. Army Intelligence, and stationed in Verona, Italy. He was discharged as a Lieutenant and went to work as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun. Mr. Iams returned to the Army and was stationed in Darmstadt, Germany, where he first served as copyeditor and eventually became the entertainment editor for the Stars and Stripes newspaper.<br/><br/>After returning home in 1986, Mr. Iams took a job as a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, working his way through the ranks until he became the society columnist. In that role, Mr. Iams covered more than 1,000 events a year, and wrote about people from a diversity of backgrounds<br/><br/>With his shock of white hair, Mr. Iams was recognizable by many, as he bicycled from function to function, covering social events for the Philadelphia Inquirer. Mr. Iams retired reluctantly in 2001. In retirement, he wrote for additional auction publications, including the newsletter for the Wheaton Arts Center in Millville, N.J. He also wrote his own personal blog about auctions and antiques, gavelsavvy.com.<br/><br/>“As I said in my final column,” he wrote to St. Paul’s, “the moment to leave a party is when you’ve having the best time.” Mr. Iams continued to freelance, but also spent time “planting potatoes and asparagus, fighting bugs and poison ivy,” and spending time with friends and family at his home in South Jersey. Mr. Iams is survived by his wife, Dorothy; his children, Tony and Sarah; his sister, Alice Kittredge; and his brother, John Iams ’61.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.spshorae.com/winter-2018-content/2018/3/21/in-memoriam" target="_blank">https://www.spshorae.com/winter-2018-content/2018/3/21/in-memoriam</a>

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">* Celebrating 200 Years **<br/><br/>Pictured is Judge M.N. Ijames, one of the most prominent and well loved members of the Mill Spring Township of Wayne County, for much of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries.<br/>Matthew Newberry Ijames, known as "Berry", was born on January 13, 1843 in Davie County, North Carolina. He was a son of Beal Rowan & Rachel Clary (Locke) Ijames. He was one of twelve children in the family. His father was a farmer and local politician.<br/><br/>He was reared to adulthood in Davie County. When the war between the states broke out, Ijames enlisted on August 6, 1861 as a Private in CO F of the 13th North Carolina Infantry, Confederate States Army. On May 5, 1862 he was severely wounded at The Battle of Williamsburg, Virginia. A month later, on June 27, he was captured in Washington D.C. and was a prisoner of war until August 5. He returned to duty for the Confederacy and was promoted to Corporal in CO F. He was captured again on July 14, 1863 at The Battle of Falling Waters, and was sent to the dreaded Union prison at Point Lookout, Maryland. On March 12, 1864 he was released in a prisoner exchange with the Union Army. Ijames continued to serve the Confederacy for the duration of the war.<br/><br/>Ijames made the journey from North Carolina to Missouri in 1868, settling in the Mill Spring Township. His oldest brother, John A. Ijames (1835-1873), had made the journey prior.<br/><br/>On August 29, 1869 he was united in marriage to Lucinda Adeline (Moss) Ijames (1853-1882). They had seven children; Beal Rowan Ijames (1870-1871), Mrs. Mary Ann (Ijames) Frazier (1872-1919), Mrs. Saphronia Belle (Ijames) Marler (1873-1931), Mrs. Ida Clara (Ijames) Ferguson (1875-1957), Lillian Jane Ijames (1878-1882), Charles Arnold Ijames (1880-1972) and Oscar Joseph Ijames (1882-1900). After the death of his first wife, Ijames married a second time to the widow Lorenda J. (Sweaza) Moss-Ijames (1859-1928). They had no children.<br/><br/>Ijames secured 210 acres of land for himself and family, and established himself a prominent farmer. An educated man of the time, he served as a school teacher in several subscription schools in western Wayne County. When the railroad reached Mill Spring in 1871, the town began to flourish. The growing population required order, and Ijames served as constable for the hamlet. In addition he was the Justice of the Peace for the Mill Spring Township for four years.<br/><br/>It was however his service to Wayne County as Western District Judge that he became most remembered for. He was elected on the Democrat ticket four different terms, serving eight years; 1886-1888, 1902-1904, 1906-1908 and 1908-1910. The remainder of his life most locals referred to him as "Judge".<br/><br/>In 1879 he became a charter member of the Brushy Creek Missionary Baptist Church, four miles from Mill Spring. This church thrived many years and Ijames served as a member until death. The building burned in 1934.<br/><br/>Ijames was a second generation Freemason. He had been initiated into the Piedmont Lodge No. 449 A.F. & A.M. and served that Lodge several years. On May 11, 1889 he transferred his membership to the Williamsville Lodge No. 107. This lodge relocated to Greenville in 1895, and Ijames remained a member there.<br/><br/>Judge M.N. Ijames passed away on August 22, 1914 at his home near Mill Spring. By all accounts his funeral was enormous. The ceremony was held in the Carson Hill Methodist Church with Rev. W.T. Webb of Bismarck officiating. Masonic services were conducted by Greenville Lodge No. 107 A.F. & A.M. Those taking part in the ceremonies were; D.S. McGee (Worshipful Master), J.F. Meador (senior warden), E.M. Smith (Junior Warden), R.M. Duckett (Treasuer), C.W. Milster (Secretary), J.L. Short (Senior deacon), Alex Moss (Junior Deacon), D.N. Holladay (senior Steward), B.E. Frady (Junior Steward), W.T. Powers (chaplain) and Abner Barrow (Marshal). Freemasons appointed pallbearers were; Frank Chilton, Frank Payne, Dr. E.C. Berryman, James Moss, Leon Haydecker and James M. Bowers. He was buried in the Carson Hill Cemetery near Mill Spring.<br/><br/>Ijames' biography was included in the 1888, "History of Southeast, Missouri", written by Goodspeed. The Ijames surname still exists locally. We honor the memory of their ancestor, Judge M.N. Ijames.<br/><br/><br/>Historical Wayne County, Missouri<br/>Mar 19, 2018<br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HistoricalWayneCountyMissouri/posts/1466857000104428" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/HistoricalWayneCountyMissouri/posts/1466857000104428</a><br/>Retrieved: Sept 25, 2020

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">William Matthew Matt Ijames, born October 7, 1981, left this earth due to natural causes to be with his Heavenly Father on June 26, 2018. He is survived by his wife of 13 years Elizabeth (Egedus) Ijames, children Jocelyn Isabella, Levi Matthew and Lucas Christopher, his mother Isabel (Godina) Ijames, sisters Victoria Lynn Ijames and Rebecca Diffin (Jonathan, Geno Anthony, Ivy and David Jeffrey), and many more grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.<br/><br/>Matt was a hardworking, dedicated and loving man who knew no strangers. He loved to travel and explore new places and foods. Matt shared his passion for all things outdoors with his children, especially hunting, fishing, guns and archery. Some of their favorite things to do together include snowboarding, hunting, fishing, shooting guns, shooting bows and arrows, making bullets, camping, swimming, playing baseball and basketball, building things together, riding roller coasters and water slides, competing to see who could finish eating first, and so much more. It gave him such joy to be able to shower them with gifts, experiences and opportunities. He had a servants heart and would spend his spare moments helping others. He enjoyed spending weekends up at Mas doing yardwork, odds and ends and experiencing the outdoors. Matt also enjoyed many yearly hunting and fishing trips with his best friends and looked forward to bringing his children along when they became old enough. He was so proud of Jocelyn for shooting her first deer (a buck!) and processing it from start to finish, hunting for turkeys in the early morning hours with Levi and fishing with Lucas who would not give up casting the next line to slay another one. He loved his family dearly and gave everything he had in him to provide for them and his mom and sisters.<br/><br/>Matt worked his way up from a degree in avionics to an unexpected detour of working on truck scales, which he hated with a passion. But he did it because he knew if he worked hard, he could provide for a potential future family. From there he met some amazing people and moved on to Electron Microscopes. Working in the field, he became determined to move up to Manager status. After many years of travel, he was honored for his loyalty, hard work and dedication by becoming a manager at Carl Zeiss Microscopy a few months before his untimely death.<br/><br/>Respected and loved by so many, work and family were not the only things that made him. Matt was also very involved in his church and alma mater, Spring Vale Christian School. Soon after graduating, he went back to work at the school as the Assistant Boys Dean and Athletic Director. Matt was on the school Board of Directors for 10 years, the last 2 of which he was Chairman. Always available to others, Matt mentored and made an impact on countless teens and young adults. He made a difference to so many just by being himself the man of God he was created to be. No one could replace him and he will be greatly missed.<br/><br/>We may never understand why Matt had to leave us so early in this life. So, in the words of his favorite old hymn:<br/><br/>Farther along well know all about it. Farther along well understand why. Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine. Well understand it all by and by.<br/>The family asks if anyone wishes to make a donation in his honor to please do so to:<br/>Spring Vale Christian School<br/>4150 S.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">William Calvin Ijames<br/>Published 12:42 pm Tuesday, July 17, 2018<br/><br/>William Calvin Ijames, 84, of Mocksville, died on Monday, July 16, at his Mocksville residence on Parker Road), surrounded by his wife and their two surviving children and their spouses.<br/><br/>Born May 16, 1934, to William Ivan and Marjorie (Turner) Ijames, he graduated from Davie County Training School in 1952, and soon developed a reputation for leadership, business, and humanitarian service in Davie County and beyond. As a young adult, he was part of a delegation of youth leaders invited to visit then President Truman at the White House; later he became president of the National Farmers of America (at local, state and national levels); and was known throughout the county for his social, civic and religious contributions.<br/><br/>After marrying his life-long companion, Vertie Mae (Coulter) in 1955, he worked for the US Army Finance Department, the IRS in Greensboro, owned and operated Mocksville Professional Services, successfully pursued entrepreneurial ventures, including sales, real estate, janitorial services, adult day care, and retired from Ingersoll-Rand where he served with distinction as a supervisor for more than 30 years. In addition to his career and business ventures, he found time to take up flying as a hobby, owned several airplanes, and maintained his private airstrip on the family farm near the Center community.<br/><br/>God blessed Calvin and Vertie’s union with three children: Jeff (Isabel of Michigan), deceased 1983, Steve (Rachel) of Mocksville, and Marjolene (Whaid) of Denver. Motivated by Jeff’s death to minister to bereaved parents, Calvin and Vertie became local leaders of The Compassionate Friends, and eventually served on the TCF National Board. He received numerous honors and awards throughout the years for community service, including the N.C. Governor’s Award, the Jefferson Award (WBTV), the E.C. Tatum Humanitarian Award, the Sertoma Service to Mankind Award, and was recognized (along with Vertie) for 15 years of volunteer service at Wake Forest University Baptist Hospital.<br/><br/>In his later years, Calvin earned advanced credentials from the American Association of Christian Counselors in order to be better equipped in his efforts to assist hurting people, and published a book, “Survival Tools for the Christian Journey,” as a resource for providing hope and encouragement.<br/><br/>Most important, he was a dedicated Christian who loved the Lord, and served as a lay leader for many years. He was raised and served in the Church of God Body of Christ (as a preacher’s kid), was a leader in the Church of God (Seventh Day) for more than three decades, and was blessed by the fellowship of the Statesville Seventh Day Adventist Church during his final years. He was driven in his pursuit of excellence and had a passionate desire to help those around him get it right regarding life, faith in God, and service to others. His life of integrity and influence can be summarized by this single Bible verse: “It is better to be respected than to be rich; a good name is better than money in the bank” (Proverbs 22:1, paraphrased).<br/><br/>Survivors: his wife of 63 years; 2 children and their spouses; 6 grandchildren, Vicki Ijames (Georgia), Becky Ijames Diffin (Jonathan) of Michigan, Paul Ijames (Emily) of Colorado, Reuben (Meagan) of Mocksville, Arvella Rose and Nathan Rose (Colorado); 9 great-grandchildren; an adopted sister (Minnie Scott); an uncle (John Lester Ijames); an aunt (Edna Mason Allen, 100); and a host of other relatives and friends.<br/><br/>A seventh grandchild, Matt Ijames (Liz), Jeff’s youngest child, preceded him  in death on June 26.<br/><br/>The funeral (open to the public) will be held at Davie Funeral Service in Mocksville, on Monday, July 23 at 2 p.m. followed by burial at the Clement Grove Church Cemetery.<br/><br/>Memorials: CareNet Counseling Center or Center Fire Department.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.ourdavie.com/2018/07/17/william-calvin-ijames/" target="_blank">https://www.ourdavie.com/2018/07/17/william-calvin-ijames/</a>

Isabel (though she preferred to be called Barbara, to her nieces and nephews she will always be "Aunt Isy") remained in Billings through her high school graduation.<br/><br/>Following her high school graduation Barbara held positions as a teacher in Terry, MT, as well as working for Northwest Airlines. During her Northwest days she resided in New York City for a time. She often talked of outings in NYC when she and her roommates would venture to Harlem to see the music and drink Scotch and milk (a concoction that to this day makes her son shake his head and say "Why?")<br/><br/>After her return to Billings, MT she met the love of her life Robert James Griffith. Robert was a member of the Montana Highway Patrol and frequently courted Barbara at the Muzzleloader, a popular Billings establishment. They were married on April 6, 1968 in a decidedly understated ceremony (the term "elopement" could be used without much question). They spent the first year of their marriage in Chicago while Robert (aka "Griff") attended Northwest University on a grant to receive his degree in Criminal Justice.<br/><br/>In 1969 Robert was assigned to MHP HQ in Helena where they resided in a basement apartment on Knight Street. It was during their residence in this apartment that Barbara gave birth to her son, Patrick, at St. Peters Hospital on January 3, 1970. It was also during this time that Robert and Barbara decided to build a house in the far north Helena valley. While working to build their house Robert said, according to Barbara, "We can have a boat, a lake cabin, and nice cars...but it means we both have to work." Barbara said she replied "I'll stay home and raise the kid...who wants a damn boat anyway?" Barbara enlisted the help of her father and the couple’s friends to help with the house. The daughter of a carpenter, Barbara inherited the knack for woodworking, a trait which would constantly infuriate and befuddle her husband, though he made an almost inhuman effort to help. At the time few, if any, people were building that far out into the Helena valley. At one point they had to make an up-front payment for concrete because the concrete company could not believe "any idiots were building way the hell out there". It would be almost 2 years before the home they dreamed of was completed. Barbara and Robert then lived in that home for the next 30+ years, enjoying the view and raising their son.<br/><br/>On April 1, 1994 Robert retired from the MHP as the longest serving law enforcement officer in the history of Montana. They then began their retirement years, which consisted of frequent "mini-vacations" in which Barbara would pick a small town in Montana; they would drive there and explore the area while simultaneously finding the best bars and restaurants. Given the nature of Montana, the bars were fairly easy to locate, the restaurants...kind of hit and miss! Another highlight of their retirement years was their annual trip to Las Vegas for the "Retired MHP Golf Tournament", at which they frequently met and played in the tournament with their son. They spent many hours conversing with their son and old friends at the various "Keno bars" on Freemont Street in downtown Vegas.<br/><br/>On January 17, 2010 life changed for Barbara upon the passing of her beloved Robert. While she mourned the change, her spirit was undaunted and she decided to sell her home of almost 38 years and move to Texas to be closer to her son. A Montana/North Dakota girl at heart, she decided after 2+ years that the "big city" life of Dallas/Fort Worth was not for her and moved back to Billings, MT to be near to her siblings. After almost 3 years back in Billings, her wanderer’s spirit once again made itself known, and she returned to Texas for another 2 1/2 years. The majority of that time she resided with her son. They took frequent drives into the Texas countryside and had many dinner/lunch outings and visited many of the local "dive" bars (probably her favorite part of the trip, she did like a good Jack Daniels "Ditch"). Her desire for home and family showed through once again though, and she returned to Billings to once again be near her siblings. Unfortunately, a series of strokes and other health problems shortly after her return to Montana resulted in her residence at the Aspen Meadows facility in Billings. Barbara resided there until the end of her life, which occurred peacefully in her sleep. Many thanks to the staff of Aspen Meadows who kept watch over her when we could not.<br/><br/>Barbara rejoined her beloved Robert in the early morning of January 27, 2019. While we will always miss her presence, we can take solace in that her suffering is over and she is at peace with her beloved.<br/><br/>Isabel Barbara Iams Griffith was preceded in death by her parents Aaron Iams, Barbara Iams, brother Michael Iams (Grace), and husband Robert James Griffith.<br/><br/>She is survived by loving siblings Lucille Mares (the late Timothy), Jeffery Iams (Barb), Douglas Iams (Gloria), and Sarah Swearingen (Charles). Barbara is also survived by numerous nieces, nephews, their children, and her son Patrick (April). At her request, cremation has taken place and no services are planned.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">RUTH (BRADDOCK) IAMS<br/><br/>Age 90, of Murrysville formerly of Plum, passed away peacefully surrounded by her loved ones April 14, 2019. Ruth was born in Wind Ridge, PA to the late Harry and Gail (King) Braddock. She is survived by her loving husband of 68 years, Duane Iams; children, Douglas (Linda) and Barbara Iams; grandchildren, Andrew and Ashley Iams; and preceded in death by her brother, Paul (Ruth) Braddock.<br/><br/>Ruth graduated from Richhill High School in 1946 and then enrolled in Waynesburg College. While enrolled, she met and fell in love with Duane B. Iams of Sycamore, PA. She graduated college in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. Upon graduation she began working in Waynesburg hospital as a medical technician in the general lab. She married Duane on January 26, 1951 and together they moved to the suburbs of Pittsburgh, eventually moving into a beautiful home on two acres of land in Plum Borough, PA. After relocating, she began working at St. Francis and then Montefiore Hospitals.<br/><br/>Ruth was a devout Christian and a member of the Presbyterian Church of Plum Creek. Her passion for travel and love for adventure was sparked from a young age when her family took a two-week road trip in their 1936 Chevrolet from Wind Ridge, PA to the California Coast. From that point forward, the majesty and grandeur of the national parks and western mountains motivated her travels. Ruth and her family took many trips exploring the United States and Canada in their Scotty trailer. Throughout her life, Ruth's journeys took her to 49 of the 50 states, to Europe, Asia, and South America. Her adventures inspired many around her and later in life, she enjoyed hearing about the trips of others. Although a world traveler, her love for the country frequently took her back to her childhood home in Wind Ridge, PA to visit her family and close friends.<br/><br/>Friends received Wednesday 2-4 and 6-8 p.m. at SOXMAN FUNERAL HOMES, LTD., 7450 Saltsburg Road (at Universal Road) Penn Hills, PA 15235. where a Funeral Service will be held Thursday 11 a.m. Interment Private.

She had friends in the North Fork who lost their homes.<br/><br/>Shepherd, now 76 years old, said the 2003 fire was a watershed event for many people with properties in the remote, wild and achingly beautiful territory along the North Fork of the Flathead River — habitat residents share with grizzly and black bears, moose, elk, deer, lynx, wolves, mountain lions, wolverines and numerous species of birds.<br/><br/>“The Wedge Fire was a catalyst for the North Fork to get together for fire mitigation,” she said.<br/><br/>Shepherd had long dreamed of building a larger home on an especially buildable site of her 78 acres north of the Trail Creek Road. She had been working for years to thin the trees in the vicinity of her one-room cabin and to adopt other measures to reduce fuels that could feed a wildfire.<br/><br/>After the Wedge Canyon Fire, she decided to move forward with building a home that would be wildfire resistant. Shepherd retired the same year as the fire from her work as a lawyer in Missoula, where she had moved in 1975.<br/><br/>She worked with architect John Wells of MMW Architects in Missoula and builder Dennis Frey.<br/><br/>Construction of the 3,000-foot-plus-square-foot home occurred during 2005 and 2006.<br/><br/>Shepherd said Frey turned out to be the perfect fit for a project presenting such unique challenges. Her property is about 16 miles north of Polebridge and roughly six miles from the Canadian border.<br/><br/>“He is very resourceful and a great trouble-shooter,” Shepherd said of Frey.<br/><br/>The challenges began when excavation for a root cellar discovered springs. A French drain provided a remedy.<br/><br/>To promote wildfire resistance, the primary building materials included concrete block, corrugated metal siding and metal roofing. Screen mesh was installed to discourage infiltration of the eaves by smoldering wildfire embers.<br/><br/>The off-the-grid home relies on solar panels, batteries and a diesel generator for electricity, and on propane and wood for heat.<br/><br/>Smiling, Shepherd said she had the sense that a few of her North Fork neighbors – those wed to traditional log-home construction deemed appropriate for the landscape — were initially skeptical about whether the metal and block house would be compatible with a wilderness aesthetic.<br/><br/>She imagined that some worried it would be an “uber-contemporary monstrosity.” For a time, Shepherd felt grateful the house would not be visible from either the North Fork Road or the Trail Creek Road.<br/><br/>Yet she said the diverse North Fork community typically leans toward acceptance of differences.<br/><br/>“Instead of carrying their predilections and prejudices, they are willing to open their eyes and make fresh judgments,” Shepherd said.<br/><br/>She became an active participant in community discussions about how residents could work to make their homes and properties less vulnerable to wildfire. Shepherd is currently co-chair with Allen Chrisman of the North Fork Landowners Association’s Fire Mitigation Committee.<br/><br/>Chrisman retired in 2008 as a forester for the Forest Service.<br/><br/>The committee has helped draft a wildfire protection plan. It reports: “The North Fork community occupies a corridor at risk from severe wildlife. The corridor is approximately three miles wide and thirty-five miles long, extending from Big Creek to the Canadian Border along the North Fork of the Flathead River.”<br/><br/>The committee noted also that properties from Trail Creek to the Canadian Border are considered particularly at risk, partly because “the area has not burned since the fires of the early twentieth century.”<br/><br/>Shepherd and others moved forward with projects and educational efforts to help property owners in the North Fork learn about wildfire protection. She helped the community achieve a Firewise USA designation from the National Fire Protection Association. The Firewise USA program is co-sponsored by the Forest Service, the U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Association of State Foresters.<br/><br/>Chrisman expressed appreciation this week for Shepherd’s efforts.<br/><br/>“Molly is the original ‘Energizer Bunny’ when it comes to Firewise, fire and fuels mitigation and good forest management,” Chrisman said.<br/><br/>“With the construction of her fire-resistant house, Molly is the role model for construction in the North Fork,” he said.<br/><br/>Chrisman added that Shepherd has been a driving force for the annual Firewise Days held each summer and said she was also instrumental in getting the North Fork Community Wildfire Protection Plan completed.<br/><br/>“Molly has earned respect from not only people up and down the North Fork, but also those engaged at the regional level in efforts to integrate people into a wildland fire environment in a safe manner,” Chrisman said.<br/><br/>The exterior of Shepherd’s wildfire-resistant house, with its corrugated metal siding, steel and concrete block, has a utilitarian feel. But the interior has a warm and spacious ambiance. There is a profusion of natural light, a roomy kitchen designed for socializing, a bedroom that provides views of the Whitefish Range out one window and of the Livingston Range out of another and a tower that offers both a place of tranquility and views that might help keep track of a wildfire.<br/><br/>Molly Raney Shepherd was born in Woodland, California, and grew up in Bakersfield. But she has family ties to the Flathead Valley.<br/><br/>“My maternal great-grandfather, Thomas A. Churchill, settled in the Flathead Valley in 1891,” Shepherd said.<br/><br/>Churchill was one of Flathead County’s first commissioners. Shepherd’s grandmother grew up and went to school in the Flathead Valley.<br/><br/>Shepherd’s parents were Marksbury Raney, an agricultural manager, and Mary Raney, a homemaker who was active in the community. Shepherd has three younger brothers.<br/><br/>“We spent a lot of time in the Sierras when I was growing up,” she said. “My parents were lively, active people who loved the outdoors.”<br/><br/>Shepherd graduated in 1964 from Swarthmore College, a private, liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. For a time, she considered studying for a master’s degree in American history.<br/><br/>She ended up getting a law degree from the University of Montana School of Law.<br/><br/>Within days of moving to Missoula in 1975, Shepherd traveled with her soon-to-be-husband up to the North Fork to visit a colleague of his at the University of Montana. She was enchanted by the landscape and the lifestyles she encountered there.<br/><br/>In 1987, she purchased the 78 acres north of the Trail Creek Road. She hired a builder to construct the one-room cabin and associated outbuildings in 1988.<br/><br/>Her work in Missoula precluded regular visits to the North Fork. She dreamed of the day when she would be free to live there year-round.<br/><br/>That day came with retirement in 2003.<br/><br/>Shepherd’s 78 acres include an abundance of western larch, a fire-resistant conifer for which she feels a special affinity.<br/><br/>On a large loom, Shepherd weaves rugs in geometric patterns. One rug honors the larch. Its colors include a yellow representing the autumn hue of the trees’ needles.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, the Flathead Land Trust and Shepherd announced that she had arranged to place her 78 acres in a conservation easement with the land trust.<br/><br/>The easement allows her to own and manage the property as she has for years. The Flathead Land Trust said the easement “ensures that the property will never be subdivided or overly developed even after she passes it on to her heirs or it transfers to other owners, thus ensuring protection of its wildlife habitat and open space in perpetuity.”<br/><br/>Shepherd has a daughter, Kate Garnett, who lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and a son, Nat Johnson, in Missoula.<br/><br/>Shepherd said this week that stewardship of the property and the habitat it provides for wildlife has been a focus from the beginning of her time on the land.<br/><br/>“When I first bought the place, it was pretty much a tangle,” she said. “It has been logged repeatedly and not very responsibly.”<br/><br/>Shepherd enrolled in coursework to learn about forest management and how to apply that knowledge to create a healthier landscape.<br/><br/>She said wildlife seems to find refuge on her property, which includes a bench above the Trail Creek drainage.<br/><br/>In 2015, a few days before Thanksgiving, Shepherd took her two Cairn terriers on a walk. They were leashed. As the trio headed back home, walking up from Trail Creek Road, Shepherd noticed the dogs staring at something nearby.<br/><br/>“I looked where they were looking and there was a huge grizzly bear looking at us and we were probably within about 25 feet of the bear,” she said.<br/><br/>“I had my bear spray out. I talked to the bear. It may well have reassured him that we were not a threat,” Shepherd said.<br/><br/>She and the dogs walked home.<br/><br/>“The bear stayed until the Monday after Thanksgiving,” she said. “It had killed an elk and cached the carcass and was sleeping on it.”<br/><br/>After the bear moved on, eagles and ravens and a host of other animals came to claim what the bear had not, Shepherd said.<br/><br/>Regional wildlife officials often say that many residents of the North Fork seem to have learned how to co-exist with grizzly bears. For example, the residents know how to secure items, like trash, that might attract the bears.<br/><br/>Shepherd carries bear spray when she strolls around her property.<br/><br/>It seems she fell in love with the North Fork at first sight and that time has done nothing but intensify her affection for the wild country and the community of people who occupy its outposts of private land.<br/><br/>“This is such a remarkable place,” Shepherd said. “I feel so lucky to have ended up here.”<br/><br/>Reporter Duncan Adams may be reached at dadams@dailyinterlake.com or 758-4407.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Authorities investigating reported abduction and suicide in London<br/>By Editor Columbus Messenger -September 18, 2019<br/>By Christine Bryant<br/>Staff Writer<br/><br/>An alleged abduction earlier this week ended with the suicide of the alleged captor as police closed in.<br/><br/>At 10:57 p.m., Sept. 16, London Police responded to a dispute at the Speedway store, 102 W. High St. Callers reported an individual with a handgun was attempting to take a vehicle, according to a London Police Department news release.<br/><br/>A Madison County Sheriff’s Office deputy located the individual, who had fled the scene to a nearby neighborhood. As officers caught up to him walking down the street, the individual held a handgun to his head and told them to stay away, according to the release.<br/><br/>He then sat down on the curb and fired one shot into his head. Medics responded and pronounced Shane C. Iams, 50, of London, dead at the scene, London Police Chief Glenn Nicol said.<br/><br/>An initial investigation determined Iams had allegedly abducted an ex-girlfriend from her nearby home at gunpoint. She was able to attempt an escape at the Speedway store, where Iams allegedly fled from her and her vehicle.<br/><br/>The incident remains under investigation by the London Police, the Madison County Sheriff’s Office and the Madison County Coroner’s Office.<br/><br/>Nicol says the coroner’s office has not yet released any further information regarding the case.<br/><br/>Retrieved: 27-Apr-2020.  <a href="https://www.columbusmessenger.com/authorities-investigating-reported-abduction-and-suicide-in-london.html" target="_blank">https://www.columbusmessenger.com/authorities-investigating-reported-abduction-and-suicide-in-london.html</a>

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Pawcatuck - Vera Garlow Iiams, 94, passed away Saturday, Nov. 23, 2019, at Fairview Nursing Home surrounded by loving family members.<br/><br/>Vera was born in Pawcatuck, Nov. 3, 1925, to John and Vera Garlow, their third daughter. She was a graduate of Stonington High School, class of 1943.<br/><br/>Growing up on a farm in Pawcatuck that was perched on a hill off Pequot Trail, Vera dreamed of traveling past the horizon she saw in the distance. Her dream came true when she met her husband-to-be, a young Navy fighter pilot stationed at Charlestown Air Station.<br/><br/>Christmas Eve, 1949, Vera married Meryl "Mike" Austin Iiams of Corvallis, Ore. After their wedding in Westerly, R.I., the couple honeymooned by driving across the country to Mike's assignment in Monterey, Calif. They shared a beautiful life together moving to many different states and to London, England, where Mike was assigned the post of Assistant Naval Attaché. It was during this four-year period in London that Vera honed her cooking and entertaining skills. She continued to cook gourmet meals and set beautiful tables throughout the rest of her life. Anyone who was invited to a dinner at the Iiams' was in for a treat: delicious food, beautiful surroundings and spirited conversations. One of Vera's personal beliefs was that every place in the world has its charm; wherever the Navy sent the Iiams family, Vera set out to make a warm and nurturing home and meet new friends. Until the end, Vera looked for the good in people and in her surroundings.<br/><br/>Vera loved to laugh, and as all those who knew her can attest, her laugh was infectious. Never one to turn down an invitation to live life to its fullest, Vera loved to travel, listen to music, dance and socialize. In her 80s, she travelled to Europe, Peru and India. She had a strong sense of patriotism and was a passionate supporter of our armed forces.<br/><br/>After retirement, Vera and Mike settled in Pawcatuck and undertook the challenge of building their own house. She volunteered at the Westerly Library spending countless hours directing the book sale for many years. In 2002 she was awarded the Gold Leaf Award for her dedicated service to the library. Community giving was a priority, and she served her community through generous donations of time and funding.<br/><br/>Vera is survived by her son, Dr. Gordon Iiams (Barbara) of Suffolk, Va.; and daughter, Betsy Iiams (T.J. Dooling) of Pawcatuck; four grandchildren, Jeffery Iiams, Joshua Iiams, Emily Dooling, and Jaime Caldwell. Vera held many close friends near to her heart and considered them extended personal family members. She is predeceased by her loving husband, Captain Meryl A. Iiams and son, Lieutenant Jeffrey Allen Iiams.<br/><br/>A celebration will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 30, at Buckler-Johnston Funeral Home, 121 Main Street, Westerly. A calling hour for visitation will be held from 10 to 11 a.m. at the funeral home prior to the service. Burial will be held at Arlington Cemetery at a later date.<br/><br/>In lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be made in Vera's name to Westerly Library and Wilcox Park, 44 Broad Street , Westerly, RI 02891, <a href="https://www.westerlylibrary.org/" target="_blank">https://www.westerlylibrary.org/</a><br/><br/>For online condolences, please visit www.buckler-johnston.com.<br/><br/>To Plant Memorial Trees in memory, please visit our Sympathy Store.<br/>Published in The Day on Nov. 26, 2019.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Nola Nile Iiams<br/>Dec 29, 1927 - Apr 21, 2020<br/>Graveside Service<br/><br/>4/27/2020 2:00:00 PM<br/>Mount Hope Cemetery<br/>Nola Nile (Elkins) Iiams<br/><br/>Nola Nile Iiams, 92, of Lander, passed away peacefully on the sunshiny morning of April 21, 2020; at The Springs at Grand Park in Billings, Montana.<br/>Due to the Corona Virus Pandemic, family graveside services will be conducted on Monday, April 27, 2020, at 2:00 p.m., Mount Hope Cemetery in Lander, Wyoming.<br/><br/>Nola was born at home to Waunita (Wood) and Byron E. Elkins on December 29, 1927; Worth County, Green Township in Oxford, Missouri. While growing up she was surrounded by four grandparents and three great grandparents within a five mile radius. Her father was first to plant soy beans in the area and had a successful year. By the next year, 1944, everyone was planting soy beans and less profitable. So her father loaded up the family in a 36’ Chevy and headed west to Torrington, Wyoming. In 1946 Nola was stricken with Polio, dominating her right side. She went on to graduate from Torrington High School in 1947. She obtained valuable work experience working for Citizen Bank, Goshen County News, and Jordan Construction Company. Nola headed to Denver, Colorado with Florabelle Bohonnan (Carroll) to attended Denver Beauty School. She received her certification /license and went to work for Blanche Underwood in Torrington as a beautician. She relinquished her license in 2014. Our mom has always been a good person or so we thought until she revealed something shortly before her passing. In 1946 when she had Polio, their house was quarantined, but her older sister, Shirley, persuaded her to leave (sneak) out of the house, which she felt obliged to do. We have no idea why this occurred she didn’t say or want to say what she accomplished from this deed.<br/><br/>Nola’s mom, Waunita, was waitressing in a Torrington café when she introduced Nola to John E. (Jack) Iiams. Jack captured Wuanitas attention by switching sugar and salt shaker contents and untying her apron strings. They were married January 1, 1951, in Douglas, Wyoming at the Episcopal Church which was halfway between families in Torrington and Lander. John and Carol Lambert were Best Man and Maid of Honor.<br/><br/>Their first home was in Cody, 1951, 1952 their oldest daughter, Kathy, was born in Powell. Jacks job with the Soil Conservation Service took them to Riverton in 1953 where they purchased their first home. In 1954 they moved to the Charles Birdell and Sally Iiams ranch in Lander. It was here they had their second daughter, Cindy. They enjoyed living in Wheatland and Worland until returning back to Lander in 1978.<br/><br/>Nola loved collecting anything with a history. She knew the history of Lander and thrived on learning more. She accomplished Iiams linage back to 1300’s and Elkins/Wood family to 1600’s. Many vacations were spent looking through cemeteries to find that one grave stone which gave her a desire to know more.<br/><br/>Nola was involved in life as Girl Scout Leader and 4-H Leader (Dough Dobbers). Was on the Fremont County Election Board at the Iiams School house on Hwy 287, member of First United Methodist Church serving and cooking for many dinners and enjoying working with everyone at the Thrift Shop for 37 years on Mondays and Thursdays. She chaperoned youth groups, Worland Tyrolean, was member of Professional Women’s Club in Torrington and Progressive Women in Riverton.<br/><br/>She was a seamstress extraordinaire, if a new fashion was in the store, she checked it out , go home and put it together for herself and daughters, always made Easter and Christmas outfits including the coats. Her favorite project was sewing doll clothes for Barbie, Mary Poppins including coats, shoes, and stockings. She also sewed outfits for Tyrolean group and made curtains for all the cabins at 4-H camp. She loved card games, Bingo and Dominos.<br/><br/>She loved without reservation, her husband, children and grandchildren. She cherished friendships made over the years throughout Wyoming and her memory never failed her. She gave it her all for her family. The Lord gave us the best he had for a Mom and Grandma, we will miss her deeply but will treasure the time she was here with us.<br/><br/>Nola is survived by her daughters, Donna Kathryn (Raye) Williams and Cindy Kim (Tony) Leenknecht; grandsons, John Nolan Kyle Williams, Tucker Jon Leenknecht and Tanner Maurice Leenknecht.<br/><br/>She was preceded in death by her parents, Byron E. and Waunita Elkins; husband, John E. “Jack” Iiams; and three sisters, Wanda Lorrane (George) Backhus, Shirley Eileen (Dorlan) Laird, and Bernadine Fayne (Arthur) Spillars.<br/><br/>Memorials may be made to Masonic Lodge #2 or 1st United Methodist Church in Lander in care of Davis Funeral Home, 2203 West Main, Riverton, WY 82501.<br/><br/>On-line condolences for the family may be made at theDavisFuneralHome.com.<br/><br/>Services are under the direction of the Davis Funeral Home

He overcame significant physical challenges to graduate from Grace Davis High School, Modesto Junior College, and CSU Stanislaus with a degree in history. He took great pride and satisfaction in both working, and then volunteering, at the Stanislaus County Library in his younger years. He helped his parents on their small family farm for many years.<br/>Pat was very fond of puns and one-liners, and no one laughed more at them than he did. He was a great fan of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Green Bay Packers, enjoyed folk music, and managed to always make the best out of his often challenging situation. We will miss his quick grin and his indomitable spirit.<br/>Pat was predeceased by his parents Bob and Jean, and is survived by his sister Sharon, brothers Mike (Anne) and Terry (Melanie), nieces Katie, Chrissy, and Emily, and nephews Zach and Wesley. Both Pat and his family appreciate the attentive and compassionate care that he received from Miriam Diaz and her staff at Orangeburg Manor, Michelle Tello and her coworkers at Valley Rehabilitation Center, and Cecile and her team at Community Hospice.<br/>Because of Covid-19 restrictions, his Mass of Christian Burial will be private. The family suggests that any remembrances be made in his name to Community Hospice Foundation, 4368 Spyres Way, Modesto, CA 95356.<br/>www.cvobituaries.com
