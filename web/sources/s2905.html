<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote">Portrait & Biographical Records Of Johnson & Pettis Counties Missouri (see source citations)<br/><br/>WILLIAM IIAMS. This gentleman was born in North Carolina, and the success which he has attained is only another example of what industry and perseverance can accomplish on the fertile soil of Missouri. He is now the possessor of a fine estate of two hundred and seventy acres, located on sections 19 and 30, township 47, range 25.<br/><br/>Our subject's birth occurred in May, 1838, in Davidson County, N.C., his parents being Richard and Ellen (Collett) liams, the former born in Maryland, and the latter in Davidson County, N. C. The paternal grandparents of William were Thomas and Nancy liams, both natives of the state of Maryland, and farmers by occupation during the greater portion of their lives, although the former was a millwright and carpenter by trade. After their removal to Davidson County, N.C. , he purchased property and gave his attention almost entirely to farming. He was an expert miller, however, and later erected a watermill on his place, making the wheel sixteen feet high.  He was a cripple for many years, having been injured by falling from a house which he was engaged in building.  He departed this life in Davidson County when our subject was a lad of ten years.  His wife died two years later.<br/><br/>Richard liams lived at home until his marriage, when he began in life for himself by farming in Davidson County. He, too, was a carpenter, having been instructed in this trade by his honored father, and there still is a barn standing in the above county which is a fair sample of his handiwork. He became prominent in local affairs, and was deserving of the respect conferred upon him as one of the most useful members of the community. He died March 12, 1857, while the mother of our subject passed away when William was seven years of age.<br/><br/>The original of this sketch was the youngest member of the parental household. Of his brothers and sisters we note the following: Faith, now Mrs. Madison C. Dean, lives in North Carolina; John is single and is farming in his native state; Charlie married Alma Peterson, and makes his home on a good farm in Lafayette County, Mo.; Lucy became the wife of Wilson Cecil, a farmer of Davidson County, N. C; Margaret married Andrew Russell, and departed this life in 1882; Ellen, Mrs. Booth, whose husband is deceased, is living in Forsyth County, N. C; and Thomas died at the age of ten years.<br/><br/>William liams was nineteen years of age when he began farming on his own account. He continued thus engaged until 1858, when, in company with his brother Charles and uncle George, he started for Missouri. The journey was made overland with teams, and upon arriving in the state they stopped for one month in Cornelia, Johnson County. They then moved on to Lafayette County, and there our subject rented a farm and lived until 1865. In March of that year he returned to this section and lived with a Mr. Taggart, for whom he worked until 1873. April 26 of that year he purchased one hundred and seventy acres of the present farm, at once making thereon good improvements. As the years rolled by he added to his land, and is now the proprietor of two hundred and seventy acres, on which are buildings of substantial character and a goodly amount of live stock. The entire tract is under admirable tillage, with the exception of forty acres which is yet timber-land.<br/><br/>While living with Mr. Taggart, our subject was married, June 7, 1874, to Miss Elizabeth Stone, who was born in this county, July 9, 1848. She is the daughter of Jehu and Nancy (Lanear) Stone, natives of Davidson County, N. C, where they were reared, but were married after coming to Johnson County, this state. They are both now deceased, the mother passing away in March, 1862, and Mr. Stone February 10, 1891. Their two children were Mrs. liams and Walter, the latter of whom married Mary Caldwell, and now lives on a farm in the southern portion of this county.<br/><br/>Soon after his marriage Mr. liams located upon his present place, which he has continued to<br/>make his home ever since. His family includes ten children, namely: Richard, born April 7, 1876; Hale, July 25, 1877; Walter, March 24, 1879; Sarah, September 30, 1880; Thomas, October 16, 1882; Margaret, March 15, 1S84; Charlie, September 10, 1885; Isaac, June 15, 1887; Lucy, March i, 1889; and Ellen, September 22, 1890.<br/><br/>August 4, 1861, Mr. liams enlisted in the Union army as a member of Company A, State Militia, under Major Neale and Captain Taggart. During his service of eleven months he participated in several skirmishes, among them being those at Wellington and Dover. In the last named place his horse was shot from under him and he was also injured. On account of his earnest pleading to stay in camp, he was permitted to do so, and when fully recovered was given another horse and continued to serve in the militia until December 31, 1862, when he was honorably discharged and came home. He will ever remember this trip, for it was made on one of the coldest days of that winter, and before he could reach shelter he had frozen both his ears.<br/><br/>In politics our subject is a stanch Republican, and cast his first Presidential vote for Bell and Everett. Although not a member of any church organization, he helps forward the good work by contributing' liberally of his means.
