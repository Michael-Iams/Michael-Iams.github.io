Imes, both of whom were college educated; his father was a graduate of Oberlin College. Imes attended grammar school in Oberlin, Ohio and completed his high school education at the Agricultural and Mechanical High School in Norman, Alabama. He graduated from Fisk University in 1903 with a degree in science.[1]<br/>Around 1919, Imes married Harlem Renaissance writer, Nella Larsen. The couple lived in Harlem, becoming part of the Harlem intellectual society which included intellectuals such as Langston Hughes and W.E.B. Du Bois.[2]<br/><b>Internationally renowned physicist[edit]<br/><br/></b>Imes’ research and doctoral thesis led to the publication of <i>Measurements on the Near-Infrared Absorption of Some Diatomic Gases</i> in November 1919 in the Astrophysical Journal. This work was followed by a paper co-authored and presented jointly with Harrison McAllister Randall <i>The Fine Structure of the Near Infra-Red Absorption Bands of HCI,HBr, and HF</i> at the American Physical Society and published in the Physical Review in 1920.[1] His work demonstrated for the first time that Quantum Theory could be applied to radiation in all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, to the rotational energy states of molecules as well as the vibration and electronic levels. His work provided an early verification of Quantum Theory.[2] [3] [4]<br/>It was one of the earliest applications of high resolution infrared spectroscopy and provided the first detailed spectra of molecules giving way to the study molecular structure through infrared spectroscopy.[2] [3] [5]<br/><b>Professional life[edit]<br/><br/></b>Upon graduating from Fisk, Imes taught mathematics and physics at Georgia Normal and Agricultural Institute in Albany, Georgia (presently Albany State University) and the Emerson Institute in Mobile, Alabama. Imes returned to Fisk in 1913 as an instructor of science and mathematics. During his tenure there, Imes earned a Master’s degree in science from Fisk University.<br/>In 1918, Imes earned a Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Michigan where he studied under Harrison McAllister Randall becoming the second African American to receive a Ph.D. in Physics since Edward Bouchet, did so from Yale University in 1876.<br/>In the early 1920s, Imes found difficulty in securing employment in academia. As a result, he became a physics consultant and researcher in physics at the Federal Engineers Development Corporation, in 1922 and with the Burrows Magnetic Equipment Corporation in 1924. In 1927, Imes went to work as a research engineer at E.A. Everett Signal Supplies.[2] [3] [4]<br/>During the period Imes spent in the scientific and materials industry, his work resulted in four patents for instruments which were used for measuring magnetic and electric properties.[2]<br/>In 1930, Imes returned to Fisk University where he served as Chair of the Physics Department. Imes is credited with the academic development of the physics programs at Fisk from which many of his students went on to obtain doctoral degrees from schools such as the University of Michigan. While at Fisk, Imes developed a course in Cultural Physics.<br/>In 1931, Imes was named one of the thirteen most Gifted Black Americans.[1]<br/>In 1939, he conducted research in magnetic materials at the Physics Department at New York University and continued as chair of the physics department at Fisk until his death in 1941.<br/><b>Memberships & honors[edit]<br/><br/></b>Sigma Xi National Honor Society; The American Physical Society; The American Society for Testing Materials; The American Institute of Electrical Engineers; The <i>Elmer S.

Memphis, Tennessee, 12 October 1883; d. New York, New York, 11 September 1941),<br/>physics, vibrational-rotational spectra, education.<br/>Imes conducted the first high-precision experiments measuring the infrared spectrum of several diatomic molecules: HCl, HBr, and HF. This work provided experimental verification that both the rotational and vibrational energy levels of molecules are quantized. His detailed spectrum for HCl also provided the first direct evidence for the influence of different isotopes on the spectra of molecules.<br/>Elmer Samuel Imes was the oldest of three male children born to Benjamin Albert Imes and Elizabeth Wallace. Elmer’s grandparents, Samuel and Sarah Moore Imes, were free blacks who lived as farmers in south-central Pennsylvania. His parents met while they were attending Oberlin College and married in 1880. The father obtained degrees from Oberlin College (1877) and Oberlin Seminary (1880). Both parents then became home missionaries for the Congregational Church. One of Elmer’s brothers, Albert Lovejoy, lived most of his adult life in Great Britain where he engaged in a variety of business ventures. The other, William Lloyd, became a very successful minister, theologian, and civil rights activist. William pastored integrated churches in the northeastern section of the country and was, at one time, the dean of the chapel at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.<br/><b>Education and Early Career<br/></b> . Elmer Imes attended grammar school (c. 1889–1895) in Oberlin, Ohio, and high school in (c. 1895–1899) in Normal, Alabama. He entered Fisk University circa 1899 and graduated in 1903 with a BA degree. From 1904 to circa 1909, he taught mathematics and physics at Albany Normal Institute in Albany, Georgia. Realizing both the need and desire to obtain an advanced degree, Imes enrolled in the graduate program at Fisk University circa 1909 and completed MA degree requirements in 1910. He remained at Fisk until 1914. During this period he was involved in teaching general science and mathematics classes.<br/>By 1914, Imes, having reached the limits of what could be achieved educationally at a “Negro” southern university, clearly understood that advancement to the next level of training could occur only if he were accepted at and attended one of the northern state universities. In 1915, he enrolled at the University of Michigan as a graduate student in the Department of Physics.<br/><b>University of Michigan<br/></b> . After a year of probational study, Imes was selected as a graduate fellow in 1916, a position that he held until his graduation in 1918. He began his research under the direction of Harrison M. Randall (University of Michigan, MS 1884, PhD 1902) who had recently returned from Germany where he studied infrared spectroscopy in the laboratory of Friedrich Paschen at Tübingen University. Imes’s experimental work centered on the precise measurement of the rotational-vibrational spectra of a number of diatomic molecules. In 1919 he published essentially the full contents of his doctoral dissertation in a long paper in Astrophysical Journal. In 1920 Randall published a joint paper on additional work that he and Imes completed with regard to the three molecules HCl, HBr, and HF. These new results appeared in Physical Review and were presented at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society in New York in 1920.<br/>Imes’s stay at the University of Michigan was relatively calm, and available evidence shows that he earned the respect of both his teachers and fellow graduate students. William F. G. Swann of the Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute, in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, states<br/>It was the writer’s privilege to become acquainted with Professor Imes in his graduate student days at the University of Michigan, where his research laboratory was a mecca for those who sought an atmosphere of calm and contentment.… Imes could always be relied upon to bring to any discussion an atmosphere of philosophic soundness and levelheaded practicalness. (1941, p. 601)<br/>In his last year at the university, Imes was initiated into Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, and later was listed in the sixth and several subsequent editions of American Men of Science. Imes was among the first African Americans to receive these recognitions.<br/><b>Reactions to Imes’s Work<br/></b> . Diatomic molecules can both vibrate along the bond length and rotate about their center of gravity. Classical physics predicted that the spectra of these combined phenomena should consist of three rather sharp lines lying in the infrared region. However, early spectroscopic studies, starting in the nineteenth century and extending into the first decade and a half of the twentieth century, showed unexpected “band Spectra,” that is, very broad regions of absorption spread over two frequency intervals roughly consistent with the classical predictions. A number of theoretical explanations were constructed with their physical bases continuously modified as the foundations of physics made the transformation from a classical to a quantum world view. Several prominent theorists (T) and experimentalists (E) involved in this transformation did at least a portion of their work exploring molecular band spectra. According to a detailed study of this issue by Chiyoko Fujisaki (1983a), prior to 1916 such individuals included Eva V. Bahr (E), Niels Bjerrum (T), W. Burmeister (E), Paul Ehrenfest (T), Edwin C. Kemble (E, T), Walther Nernst (T), Lord Rayleigh (T), and Heinrich Rubens (E).<br/>Some of these individuals attended the Solvay Conference held in Brussels from 30 October to 3 November 1911. This first in what would become a series of conferences was sponsored by industrialist Ernest Solvay at the behest of Nernst for the purpose of exploring quanta and radiation. During his final talk of the conference on “The Current Status of the Specific Heat Problem,” Albert Einstein raised the issue of spectra and the rotational frequency of molecules. A discussion ensued concerning methods for quantizing this particular degree of freedom. Einstein’s previous work on the specific heat of solids and its subsequent success had already paved the way toward acceptance that molecular vibrational energy was quantized.<br/>During the period from 1911 to 1916, the data obtained from various experiments were confusing and in some cases contradictory. Some experiments showed broad bands, while others gave results with bands resolved into a series of separated lines. From a later point of view, the main reason for confusion and contradictions can be viewed as arising from differing resolutions of the spectrometers used by the various experimentalists. Whereas those who were utilizing what one would later call low resolution devices essentially observed two broad bands, those utilizing what one would later call high resolution devices observed structure to the absorption bands. Thus, the data obtained from the high resolution spectrometers gave direct, but not conclusive, evidence for quantization of rotational motion and additional confirmation for quantization of vibration behaviors for diatomic molecules. By 1914, these results were being applied to the calculation of the rotational contribution to the specific heats of solids and gases. A thorough discussion of this work and the major scientists involved is given in the review by Fujisaki (1983a, b). By 1916, there was general agreement that high-precision spectra were needed for diatomic molecules to both give the detailed structure of the band spectra and provide the data required for the formulation of an adequate theory of these phenomena. In 1916, under the direction of Randall at the University of Michigan, Imes began a course of studies that led to the design and construction of a series of infrared spectrometers of continuously increasing resolving powers. Imes used these instruments to measure the absorption bands for three hydrogen halides in the near infrared region: HCl, HBr, and HF. The final spectrometer, used for his most precise work, consisted of two spectrometers connected in tandem. The first was a prism spectrometer, while the second was a grating spectrometer. Imes’s most detailed work was done for HCl. For this molecule, he found two bands near 1.76 and 3.46 microns. (The band at 1.76 microns corresponds to the first overtone of the band at 3.46 microns. The nonlinearity of the force between the H and Cl atoms is indicated by 1.76 × 2 ≠ 3.46) His instrument was able to resolve the band at 3.46 microns into twelve pairs of peaks and the band at 1.76 microns into eight pairs of peaks. Imes used this design and construction of the spectrometer, and the measured data, as the basis for his dissertation. All these results appeared in Astrophysical Journal in an extended paper in 1919.<br/>Imes’s measurements were immediately recognized by the scientific community as providing accurate experimental proof that rotational energy was also quantized, as was the case for molecular vibrational energy. The clear interpretation of his spectra was that superimposed on the spectral lines coming from the vibrational transitions of these diatomic molecules were peaks corresponding to transitions between various quantized rotational energy states.<br/>A detailed theoretical interpretation of Imes’s spectra was soon completed by Adolf Kratzer (1920a) within the framework of the emerging quantum viewpoint. He used his theory and Imes’s data to calculate the bond lengths between the hydrogen and halogen atoms for HCl, HBr, and HI and found values consistent with previous estimates.<br/>Imes’s data for HCl also indicated that each of the twelve peaks within the band located at 3.46 microns were themselves separated into two peaks (Imes and Randall, 1920). Both Kratzer (1920a) and F. Wheeler Loomis (1920) gave compelling theoretical arguments that this doublet substructure was a consequence of chlorine having isotopes of mass numbers 35 and 37. This means that HCl35 and HCl37 have slightly different locations for their absorption lines. An assessment of Imes’s work is provided by Earle Plyler:<br/>Up until the work of Imes, there was doubt about the universal applicability of the quantum theory to radiation in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some held it was useful only for atomic spectra (electronic spectra); some held that it was applicable for all electromagnetic radiation. Ames’s high resolution work on Hal, Her and HF was the first clear cut experimental verification of the latter hypothesis, namely, that the rotational energy levels of molecules are quintile as well as the vibration and electronic levels. Thus, Imes’s work formed a turning point in the scientific thinking, making it clear that quantum theory was not just a novelty, useful in limiting fields of physics, but, of widespread and general application. (Plyler, 1974)<br/>Although Plyler’s assessment may be an exaggeration in giving sole credit to Imes, his work certainly made important contributions toward widespread acceptance of the new quantum theory.<br/><b>The New York Years<br/></b> . After receiving his PhD in physics from the University of Michigan, Imes spent four years in New York City (1918–1922) where he was self-employed as a consulting physicist. A major reason for moving to New York was the lack of employment opportunities for an African American having advanced education in most regions of the country. Even locations such as Boston were generally hostile to blacks. Another reason was that New York was becoming the mecca for African Americans in various fields of the arts, literature, entertainment, and political theory and practice, and the center of the contemporary civil rights movement. The time period from about 1919 to 1930 is historically referred to as the Harlem Renaissance. It was in this environment that Imes met Nella Larsen. The two married on 3 May 1919.<br/>Larsen was an active member of the Harlem Renaissance who would eventually write two novels, Quicksand(1928) and Passing (1929). Both Imes and Larsen had overlapping interests in various scholarly, literary, and political subjects. Thus, as members of the “Negro elite,” they had ready access to and associated with many other members of the Harlem Renaissance movement such as<br/>W. E. B. Du Bois, Arna Bontemps, Aaron Douglas, Langston Hughes, Charles S. Johnson, and Walter White. When Imes later returned to Fisk University, many of these individuals would become connected to that institution either by joining the faculty or by exerting influence on its academic and teaching philosophy.<br/>During the years 1922 to 1930, Imes was employed at three engineering-based firms in the New York metropolitan area: Federal Engineers Development Corporation (1922–1924), Burrows Magnetic Equipment Corporation (1924–1927), and E. A. Evert Signal Supplies (1927–1930). His official title was research physicist or research engineer. Imes’s research and development work led to the issuance of four patents. These patents were for devices or techniques for improving the measurement of magnetic properties of various materials.<br/>By 1929, Imes had grown restless. Although he had regular employment and participated in the social, cultural, and political activities of the Harlem Renaissance, all of this was not to his satisfaction. He wanted to return to a more academic setting. The opportunity to do so occurred when he was invited to organize a formal program of physics education and research at Fisk University. He accepted the offer and returned to his alma mater in 1930 as chair of the Physics Department. His wife did not accompany him to Nashville.<br/><b>Fisk University<br/></b> . Imes had two major tasks to complete upon his return to Fisk. The first was to create a set of upper-level physics courses suitable for BA and MS degree programs. The second was to recruit students to enroll in these programs. He succeeded with both efforts. In the graduating class of 1935, he had three students who finished Fisk with BA degrees in physics and entered the graduate physics program at the University of Michigan. Of the three, one eventually received a doctorate (James Raymond Lawson), one an MS degree (Lewis Clark), and the third dropped out of the program.<br/>Both undergraduate and graduate students were involved in research. The areas selected were topics related to x-rays and magnetics. These two fields were directly related to Imes’s work as a research engineer/physicist in New York. To enhance the students’ knowledge in these areas, he arranged for them to study at the University of Michigan during the summer to master the subject of x-rays and various techniques needed for their use in his research projects. He also returned to the University of Michigan on several occasions to carry out experimental research on the fine structure of the infrared rotational spectrum of acetylene (C2 H2). Other work related to magnetic materials was done as summer research at New York University. None of these research efforts resulted in formal scientific publications.<br/>Imes belonged to several professional research organizations: the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and the American Society for Testing and Materials. Because of Jim Crow laws then in place, he was able to attend meetings of these societies only when they met in the northern region of the country or in Canada.<br/>Imes knew many on the Fisk faculty from associations formed when he lived in New York. Also, the Imes family name was well known within the elite, educated African American population, and his wife’s fame as a writer was of great value in forming other connections at the university, particularly among the nonscience faculty. In addition to constructing a curriculum for the physics program, he was also asked by the administration to help with the design of a new science building. This effort led to correspondence with other researchers, equipment designers, and manufacturers. Imes was also in charge of the film equipment and used this knowledge to aid various university clubs when a need for this equipment arose. One of the tasks that he especially enjoyed was the planning and execution of the Fisk University Annual Spring Arts Festival. This event brought to campus persons in the studio and performing arts, literature, and the sciences. Many of these individuals were of international renown and their presence and performances had great appeal to the wider Nashville community.<br/>Imes had received a superior “classical” education as an undergraduate student at Fisk. His studies included four languages (French, Greek, Latin, and Spanish), along with separate courses in chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics. Other courses covered English literature, ethics, sociology, and logic. Now as a professor at Fisk, he wanted to provide the full academic community a broad knowledge of the nature of science, how it could be applied, and its influence on general issues of importance to society. To this end, he developed a course, Cultural Physics, and wrote a book-length manuscript detailing his thoughts on these topics. He used these materials as a course text for one of the general science requirements. He also had another reason for creating this course, namely, continuing the longstanding debate over the issues as to what should be the primary focus of Negro higher education, that is, vocational training versus liberal arts. Fisk University had its genesis in the liberal arts tradition and all of Imes’s close associates agreed with this direction for their efforts in education.<br/>Nella Larsen divorced Imes in 1933. They had not lived together for any extended period since 1930. Larsen had no desire to live in the segregated south. She also wanted to remain in the New York metropolitan area where most of her friends and literary colleagues lived and where she felt her writing career would prosper. Her basis for divorce was on the legal grounds of cruelty. However, a much more dramatic reason was hinted at in a front-page story that appeared in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper (7 October 1933). This article suggested that Imes was involved in an affair “with a white member of the Fisk University’s administrative staff.”<br/><b>Scientific Legacy<br/></b> . Throughout his life and his career in science and education, Imes was held in high regard by his many friends and colleagues. His experimental work was immediately understood and interpreted as providing detailed experimental proof that rotational energy states were quantized just as was the case for the vibrational motions of molecules. Imes’s Astrophysics Journal paper was highly cited in the research literature for more than a decade and reproductions of his measured vibrational-rotational spectrum for HCl were placed in textbooks and research monographs. While Imes did not carry out additional research in the field of infrared spectroscopy, he was clearly recognized as a major figure among the small group of spectroscopists who measured with high precision diatomic spectra during the period 1916–1923.<br/>On 11 September 1941, after a long battle with cancer, Imes died in New York City. His longtime friend and colleague, William Francis Gray Swann, wrote an obituary for the journal Science. He stated:<br/>In the death of … Imes science loses a valuable physicist, an inspiring personality and a man cultured in many fields.… In his passing, his many friends mourn the loss of a distinguished scholar and a fine gentleman.

<div class="gt-comment gt-cnote"><b>Imes, Elmer Samuel</b> (12 Oct. 1883-11 Sept. 1941), physicist, was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Benjamin A. Imes, a minister, and Elizabeth Wallace. Imes attended school in Oberlin, Ohio, and at the Agricultural and Mechanical High School in Normal, Alabama. Imes then enrolled at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he received his B.A. in science in 1903. Upon graduating, Imes accepted a position at Albany Normal Institute in Albany, Georgia, where he taught mathematics and physics. He returned to Fisk in 1910 and for the next five years worked toward an M.S. in science while serving as an instructor in science and mathematics. After receiving his master's degree in 1915, Imes entered the University of Michigan's doctoral physics program, where he worked closely with Harrison M. Randall, who had recently returned from Germany. Randall had studied the infrared region of the spectrum in Friedrich Paschen's spectroscopy laboratory at Tübingen University.<br/>For the next three years, Imes investigated the infrared spectrum of three diatomic molecules: hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Experimental and theoretical work had already shown that the molecular vibrational spectrum is quantized. Imes and Randall were interested in obtaining definitive evidence that the rotational spectrum was also quantized. In 1918 Imes received his Ph.D. and published his dissertation in a long article in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i> (50 [1919]: 251-276). This work had a major impact on atomic physics: "In 1919, Randall and Imes published a single work that opened an entirely new field of research: the study of molecular structure through the use of high resolution infrared spectroscopy. Their work revealed for the first time the detailed spectra of simple-molecule gases, leading to important verification of the emerging quantum theory and providing, for the first time, an accurate measurement of the distances between atoms in a molecule" (Krenz, p. 12). Another view of Imes's research was presented by Earle Plyler in a 1974 speech at Fisk: "Imes' work formed a turning point in the scientific thinking, making it clear that quantum theory was not just a novelty, useful in limited fields of physics, but of widespread and general application."<br/>Imes's results were immediately recognized by quantum scientists in both North America and Europe. In the two decades after its publication the paper was extensively cited in research papers and reviews on the rotational-vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules. Within a very short time, discussions of his work and his precision spectrum of HCl was incorporated into the standard textbooks on modern physics. Imes's experimental results also provided the first evidence for the existence of nuclear isotopics. This was shown by examining the doublet structure in his absorption band structure of HCl at 1.76 microns. This feature was interpreted to mean that two isotopes of chlorine were present.<br/>As a black scientist holding a doctorate degree, Imes found his employment opportunities essentially limited to teaching at a black southern college or to seeking a position within industry or the federal government. For the next decade, Imes lived in and around New York City, where he was employed as an engineer and applied physicist. Imes's applied research and engineering activities resulted in four patents, each in the general area of measuring the properties of magnetic materials and the construction of instruments to conduct such tests. In 1920 Imes married Nella Larsen; they had no children. His own scholarly and literary interests, as well as his marriage to Larsen, one of the better-known writers of the Harlem Renaissance, allowed him to associate with many members of the "Negro" intellectual and power elite, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, Arna Bontemps, Langston Hughes, Aaron Douglas, Walter White, and Carl Van Vechten. Many of these people would reappear in Imes's life in the 1930s as members of the Fisk University faculty or through some other strong connection to the institution.<br/>In 1930 Imes was appointed chair of and professor in the physics department at Fisk, a position he held until his death. Imes initially devoted much of his time to the reorganization of the undergraduate physics curriculum and made preliminary preparations for the initiation of a full-fledged graduate program centered on research in infrared spectroscopy. Both Imes and his students were involved in several research projects; they used both X-rays and magnetic procedures to characterize the properties of materials and in the study of the fine structure of the infrared rotational spectrum of acetylene. Imes spent at least one summer at New York University carrying out experiments on magnetic materials, and he returned to the University of Michigan several summers to continue his research in infrared spectroscopy. He was active in three professional societies: the American Physical Society, the American Society for Testing Materials, and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Because of segregationist laws in the southern states he would only attend national meetings of these organizations when they were held in large northern cities or in Canada.<br/>Imes felt that the students at Fisk, as well as his friends and colleagues, should be exposed to the general outline and themes of science. To this end he developed a course, "Cultural Physics," and wrote a rather large manuscript to be used for the course. In addition to his duties as chair, Imes did detailed work on the planning and design of a new science building, and he carried out extensive correspondence with other researchers, equipment designers, and equipment manufacturers. Imes was heavily involved in the general academic and social life of the university. He operated film equipment for various university clubs, participated in both the planning and execution of the Annual Spring Arts Festival, and served on various scholarship and disciplinary committees. One of his major concerns was the education and training of his students; several of them enrolled in graduate studies in physics at the University of Michigan.<br/>Imes's marriage ended in 1933 when Larsen divorced him on the legal grounds of "cruelty." The couple had already been separated for a number of years, mainly because of her desire to pursue a writing career in New York. Imes died in New York City.<br/>Throughout his career, Imes was held in high regard by his scientific colleagues. They immediately grasped the significance of the work he did at the University of Michigan showing that both the vibrational and rotational energy levels of molecules are quantized. His experiments also provided a precise set of data that could be used to make a critical test of the emerging quantum mechanics that was being formulated in Europe. Understood but never openly articulated during his lifetime was the fact that Imes's race had placed limitations on what he could achieve in science in America.<br/>  <br/><br/><br/><b>Bibliography<br/></b>A modest collection of Imes's papers is at the Fisk University Library, Special Collections. In addition to letters dealing with routine administrative work, there is extensive correspondence with the president of the university. Other Imes papers are located in the Carl Van Vechten Personal Collection at the New York Public Library and the James Weldon Johnson Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University.
