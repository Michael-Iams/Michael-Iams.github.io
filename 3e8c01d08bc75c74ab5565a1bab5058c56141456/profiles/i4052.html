  <div class="box-body">IJAMS 04 Jul 1878 The body of Hiram Ijams was found in the Potomac river near the B&O water station #12. He lived about 2 miles above the Paw Paw tunnel and is supposed that he left home to ford the river and missed the low place plunging into the deep water and drowned. He leaves a wife and 2 children.<br/><br/><a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/MDALLEGA/2002-04/1019130" target="_blank">http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/MDALLEGA/2002-04/1019130</a> 499<br/><br/>Newspaper article - Cumberland Times - August 26, 1898<br/>IT NOW LOOKS LIKE MURDER<br/>The Wills Woman Confirms Her Husband Story<br/>New Developments in the Alleged Murder of the Long Ago - A Warrant Likely to<br/>Be Sworn Out - The Scene of the Crime As Told by Others<br/><br/>The story in the Times yesterday relative to the horrible details revealed to Henry Wills by his wife, relative to the murder of her father, Hiram Imes, 18 years ago, created no little excitement and has been the chief topic of conversation today, and many have been seen who know something about<br/>the occurrence.<br/><br/>This morning Henry Wills returned to this city, and this time brought with him his wife, and their little child. They came here for the purpose of making known the story of the crime to Sheriff Casey, and to swear out a warrant against one of the men alleged to be implicated, whose name is withheld, but who now lives at Coneilsville, Pa., and not near Hyndman, as stated yesterday.<br/><br/>It seems that there was some misunderstanding as to the place, the woman claiming today that the murder was committed in a house on Liberty Street and that after her father had been beaten into a senseless condition and before he was dead, he was carried down the canal a long distance and before he was thrown in cried out to his wife, whom it would seem was with the man and crying, that she needn't cry as she was the cause of his death or words to that effect.  Mrs. Wills says she does not know where her mother now is, or whether or not she is living.<br/><br/>The Scene Changed<br/>Mrs. William Browning of Twiggtown, this county, a cousin of the murdered man, was in town today, and stated to a reporter that she remembered very  well the circumstances connected with Hiram Imes' death.  Mrs. Browning says that the he was murdered near Okonoko and his body carried some three miles and thrown into the river. When taken from the river a number of cuts were found on his head. She stated two or three were accused of the murder, and that one of them shortly after left with the widow of the murdered man and her child [the present Mrs. Wills]. She also says that there was talk of having the woman arrested at the time, but she left, before any action was taken.<br/><br/>Several other people were seen today, one of whom stated that when the Imes' body was taken from the river, he was in a nude condition, and it, was the general opinion at the time, that the man was murdered. As the State's attorney is out of town no warrant was sworn out today, but there is no doubt that one will be sworn out in a day or two. Mrs. Wills  was in a highly excited state of mind. She seemed to be in great dread lest the man whom she implicates will yet take her life.<br/><br/>HUNTING UP AN OLD MURDER: Date and name of paper not included. [Probably about 1898]A man's wife tells him an odd Story. Henry Wills, of Hyndman, has been here looking after facts to an alleged murder. His wife says her father was killed on Mill Street 18 years ago.  What investigation shows:Day before yesterday one Henry Wills, residing at Hyndman, Pa. was in this city and was expected here today.  His business here, he stated, was to look up the facts of a murder he alleges was committed on Mill street in January, 1880. His story is as follows, and has been revealed to him by his wife.  His wife's father's name was Hiram Imes, and 18 years ago lived on Mill street, or near there.  One night in January, 1880, four men appeared at the home and asked Mrs. Imes for her husband.  They were let in, when they tied Mrs. Mills, then a child of five years, killed her father with knives and clubs, robbed the home, and then wrapped the body in a blanket and carried it to the canal and threw it in. Mrs. Wills says that her "mother" was a dissolute woman, and that one of the men who killed her father afterwards took her and her mother to Kansas where they lived for some years, or until her mother's death perhaps, when they returned to Pennsylvania. After Mrs. Mills had grown to womanhood, and before she married Wills, the man asked her if she remembered how her father met his death, and she stated yes, she remembered that he was killed by four men.  "Well," returned the man, "if you ever say anything about the matter I will kill you." The matter preyed on Mrs. Will's mind after she got married until a few days ago when she told her husband the above occurrences.  Wills says the man lived in that section, and as soon as his wife told him about the matter he went before a justice to swear out a warrant.  He was told that he would have to swear the warrant out in Maryland.  He then came here.  He stated that before swearing out the warrant he wanted to see a Mrs. Imes [David], it is thought he said] a brother to the alleged murdered man, who lived near Flintstone, and who knew the facts.  Imes was to have met Wills here today, but whether or not he did so cannot be stated.   Hiram Imes was drowned! Wills went to see a woman on Frederick Street, who is related to the Imes' by marriage, and as soon as the reporter of his paper heard the story which Wills related he went to see the woman on Frederick Street. She stated at 18 or 20 years ago Hiram Imes was drowned in the canal below here, but was not murdered and thrown into the canal, at Will's claims.  She says she cannot imagine whey they claim he was murdered unless it is because they think Hiram had some money. Has joined the church! Wills further stated that the man implicated, who threatened his wife's life, if she told what she knew, has since joined church, and that when he gives in his experience at meetings, has alluded to the matter, or to something that was on his mind, that he cannot reveal. Wills says that another man of the men implicated is at present confined in an institution near this city.<br/><br/><a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/md/allegany/newspapers/ct1898.txt" target="_blank">http://files.usgwarchives.net/md/allegany/newspapers/ct1898.txt</a><br/>The Cumberland Times<br/>IMES 26 Aug 1898 Article about a murder of Hiram Imes, 20 years ago in Jan 1880.<br/>Mrs Harry Wills reveals this fact which is collaborated by Mrs William Browning.<br/>The house was entered and the family robbed after beating Mr Imes and throwing<br/>him into the canal.
