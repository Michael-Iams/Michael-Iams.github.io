In Preston County few families have advanced a better claim to being pioneers in this region, forceful factors in its development, and workers at every point of its advancement than the Cobuns.<br/> <br/><b>It was in 1770, five years before the beginning of the Revolution, that James Cobun, a son of Jonathan, made settlement at Dorsey's Knob and built his cabin a little south of Masontown.</b> Only three years earlier Zackwell Morgan had established himself in Monongalia Count, thus gaining the historical fame of being the first settler of Morgantown. Monongalia County at that time included all of the present Preston County. <b>In 1790 James Cobun patented a thousand acres of land where he settled, and on this estate his descendants have been numerously represented for 130 years.</b> James Cobun was born in Old Virginia, December 17, 1746, and died September 17, 1822. He was a slave holding farmer, a man of means, of integrity and probity of character.<br/><br/>His wife was Sarah Troder, and she accompanied her parents to Western Virginia and was amember of the same party as James Cobun. The Indians called her "the pretty squaw." She was born September 10, 1756, and died October 1, 1843. Their children were Catherine, Susanna, James, Arthur, Isaac, John, Jacob and Sabra. The present line of the Cobuns runs through Isaac Cobun, who was born October 30, 1786, and died June 24, 1867. He spent his life as a farmer and on the lands acquired by the pioneer. He married Prudence Davis,who died January 19, 1873. Among their numerous children one was Benjamin F. Cobun, who was born in September, 1831, and lived all his life in the Masontown locality. He was a farmer and merchant, and at his death was president of the Board of Education. He was a stanch republican and a member of the Official<br/>Board of the Methodist Episcopal Church many years.<br/><br/>Benjamin F. Cobun married Jane Hartley, who was born near Masontown,and was seven years the junior of her husband and outlived him a few years. Her father was Edward Hartley,and this family was likewise connected with the early history of Preston County. Benjamin F. Cobun and wifehad the following children: Albert, who was associated with his father as a merchant and died in Preston County;Harriet, who became the wife of Samuel Fields, lived for many years in Illinois, but is now a resident of Masontown; Homer, a farmer near Reedsville; Sanford Lee;Elmer, a farmer near Masontown; Louie, wife of A. J. Stuck, of Masontown; W. G., a merchant of Reedsville; Florence, wife of Edward Wasson, of Fairview, Illinois;Myra, who married Sherman Snyder, of Keyser, West Virginia; and Allie, who died young.<br/> <br/>Sanford Lee Cobun was born within a mile of Masontown September 11, 1860, and his childhood and youth were spent thereuntil he was twenty years of age. After the select and free schools he had an experience for two or three years as clerk in the store with his father and older brother,and then took over the general mercantile business on his own responsibility, and for about thirty-five years was proprietor of the firm of S. L. Cobun. While a merchant he erected a large brick business house, now owned by the Penn-Mary Company.  After selling this property and business he erected the large hotel building across the street, and has employed his capital in other development in Masontown. He is now retired from the heavier responsibilities of business, but as an occupation he conducts a modest real estate office.<br/> <br/>Mr. Cobun was one of the organizers in 1907 of the Bank of Masontown, capitalized at $25.000, and in 1908 he succeeded Mr.E. M. Bartley as president. The Board of Directors comprised fifteen members, the active officers of the bank being Earl Dixon and Mr. Cobun, while the vice presidents are Doctor Post and H. A. Hartley. Other directors are Prentis R. Watson, E. E. Cobun, J. F. Watson, S. C. McKinney, J. E. Hartley, L N. Roby, Frank L. Street, S. D.Snyder, Earnest Watson, M. H. Orr and B. T. Gibson.The bank early in 1922 occupied its new home, a modern two-story brick building.<br/> <br/>Mr. Cobun has an interesting record of public service. He was frequently chosen to the Town Council and served one year as village mayor. In 1911 he was elected to the House of Delegates and was re-elected in 1913. During his first term the speaker of the House was Mr. Whetsell, and he was assigned as chairman of the committee on banks and banking and member of several other committees. During his second term he served under Speaker George and was again chairman of the banks and banking committee. In 1916 Mr. Cobun was elected to the State Senate for the Fourteenth District, comprising Preston, Tucker, Mineral, Grant and Hardy counties, and succeeded Bliss McCrum in the Senate. He served under Presidents Goodykuntz and Sinsel, and in both sessions was a member of the finance committee and chairman of the committee on agriculture.He introduced and secured the passage of Senate Bill No.76, empowering the preparatory school at Keyser to receive Government aid, and also Senate Bill No. 95, permitting a minimum charge of $1.00 for making a loan and interest charge for the use of the money. Another measure he introduced which became a law was that regulating commercial food products, and another was one granting a soldier from West Virginia the right to vote by mail while on active duty. Another bill which passed provided for the entry or filing of historical documents or writings with the Archives and History Department of the State at Charleston and the issuing of a copy of the manuscript to anyone making application for it. He was also a supporter of some of the measures claiming special precedence in the special sessions. He supported the ratification of the national prohibition amendment and the woman's suffrage amendment. While he was in the House of Delegates he took part in the last election of a United States senator,voting for Nathan Goff, the compromise candidate of the party, though his personal choice was David Elkins.<br/> <br/>Mr. Cobun grew up in a republican household and cast his first presidential vote for James G. Blaine in 1884 and has supported every party nominee at a national election since then. He has been a member of a number of local and congressional conventions.<br/> <br/>At Reedsville in 1885 Senator Cobun married Miss Mattie Loar, who died twelve years later. Her only child was Lucile Cobun,who died within two weeks of graduating from Buckhannon College. In 1903 Mr. Cobun married Rosa Roby,daughter of Albert Roby. She was born in Monongalia County.</li>
