<li class="gt-list-item gt-text"><b>The Family of Gedeon Senecal<br/></b>For today's post I am sharing the story of the family of Gedeon Senecal previously published in the June 2010 Bulletin of the Genealogical Forum of Oregon. As we worked on this project for the fiftieth birthday present for one of his descendants, we experienced many serendipity moments. We worked to create an accurate family history based on family information and historical documents. Please excuse any errors. If you have an interest in this family or wish to share additional information, pictures, documents, etc. we would love to hear from you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>                    The Family of Gedeon Senecal                                <br/>                         By Susan LeBlanc             <br/><br/>Several years ago, a client wanted to create a family history to present to her husband, a descendent of the Senecal family, for a 50th birthday present. This was a fun adventure through early Oregon and French Canadian records. The first generation settler in Oregon was Gedeon Senecal. He was a contemporary of Etiene Lucier, the first documented French Canadian settler, in Oregon in about 1830. In 1871, Gedeon’s daughter Thais would marry Pierre Lucier, the son of Etiene. According to Harriet Duncan Munnick, a noted historian of early French Canadian settlement in Oregon, “Senecal came relatively late, 1840, to the Prairie. He may have been with the Company much earlier, however, for he retired in 1842 to a claim on the road south of Butteville. After the death of his wife Marie Grenier in 1850, he married Lucie DuCharme. He moved to Wasco County about 1880, where he died in 1896, leaving many descendents.”[i] In the “Mantle of Elias”, from the extracted record of the marriage of Gideon Senecal and Marie Grenier, we learn that he was the eldest son of Jacques Senegal and Josephite Chrysolphe of the Prarie de la Madeleine, Canada.[ii] In this article, there is a variety of spelling of names and these reflect how they were recorded in the sources cited for each event.<br/><br/>            For this research, we first looked to the closest ancestor of the descendent, Lawrence Keith Senecal. He was born 21 August 1928 in Oregon, to Lawrence Senecal and Huereka Juanita Poole. He died 16 December 2000 in Long Beach, Los Angeles, California.[iii] In the 1930 Census this family is recorded as living in The Dalles, Wasco County, Oregon; family members being Lawrence age 29, wife Juanita age 18 and son Lawrence K. age 1 and 2/12.[iv] An unfortunate accident claimed the life of Lawrence Sr. in 1948. This information, discovered in an Internet search of the name, resulted in the finding of this newspaper article describing the accident.<br/><br/>Walla Walla Union Bulletin (Walla Walla, Washington) 1948 FebruarySix Drown in Auto Mishaps...Two men- identifed as Lawrence Senecal, 47, of Florence, Ore., and William Pruitt, 20, of Rocky Gap, Va., a crew member of the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Columbus now docked at Bremerton, Wash. - were victims of another Sunday morning highway-river accident. Police said Mrs. Senecal and a son, Keith Senecal, 19 - the latter a shipmate of Pruitt - escaped from the car after it plunged into a deep pool of the Siuslaw river near Cushman on the Oregon coast.[v]Lawrence Sr., was born 22 August 1899 in St. Louis, Marion County, Oregon, to Vital Senecal and Mary Agnes Vandale.[vi] He served in the military and in the 1920 Census his location is Mayen, Germany, Military and Naval Forces.[vii] His death date is listed as 31 January 1948 in the Oregon Death Index.[viii] Huereka Juanita Poole, was born about 1911 in Portland, Oregon, to James H. Poole and Anna Evans.[ix]<br/><br/><br/>            Vital Senecal, was born 25 August 1864 in St. Louis, Marion County, Oregon, to Gedeon Senecal and Lucille Ducharme.[x] He married Mary Agnes Vandale on 3 July 1893 in St. Louis, Marion County, Oregon.[xi] Mary Agnes Vandall was born on 9 November 1874 in St. Louis, Marion County, Oregon, to Jean Baptiste Vandall and Clementia LaChappelle.[xii]Vital and Agnes, with their family, are recorded in the 1900, 1910, and 1920 Census in Ramsey, Wasco County, Oregon. In the 1900 Census, he was listed as a farmer, renting property, with his wife, four children and five siblings.[xiii] By 1910 he owned his farm and lists “farmer” as his occupation. There are nine children living with Vit and Agnes, who the record shows has given birth to nine children. In the 1910 Census, there are several other family members on the page, Cyline his sister, her husband William Walker and their son Karl with Cyline’s siblings John B. and Emma.[xiv]  Marcell, Vital’s brother, and his family are living in Beaver Creek, Crook County, Oregon and the census includes: Marcell and Mary with grandson Floyd, George his son and his wife Annie, and another son Al Goodin next door. Marcell, George, and Al all work as Stock farmers and own their own property.[xv]  Joseph Senecal his brother was the only one still living in Dufur, was single and a laborer on a farm.[xvi]<br/><br/>            In 1920, Vit was a farmer and they have a mortgaged farm. There are six children living at home.[xvii] In the 1930 Census, he was age 64 and living as a lodger at a farmhouse in Rosebud, Grant County, Oregon. He was listed as married, 28 years, yet there are no family members living with him. His occupation was Sheep Herder on a Stock Ranch. Agnes was not located, but she was still living.[xviii] Vital died 3 September 1946[xix] and Mary Agnes died 20 June 1932, both in Wasco County, Oregon. [xx] Vital and Agnes were the parents of eleven known children. Their children were:<br/>Raymond, was born 26 July 1894, Oregon and his baptismal sponsors were Pierre Lucier and Thais Lucier.[xxi] He died 1 January 1974, Wasco County, Oregon. He married Dolly in 1929 in Hood River, Oregon.[xxii] Two adopted sons.<br/>Herman Charles, was born 11 March 1896, in St. Louis, Oregon.[xxiii] He died 24 June 1964, Oregon, buried at Eagle Point National Cemetery, Eagle Point, Oregon.[xxiv]<br/>Lucia (Lucy) Blanche, was born 7 April 1898, in St. Louis, Oregon.[xxv] She died 14 July 1991,Wasco, County, Oregon.[xxvi] She married Fred R.

She was the daughter of Jean Baptiste Ducharme, who was born in St. Genevieve de Berthierville, Canada.[xlix] In Sandra Bisset’s file on Genealogy.com, she notes that Gedeon Senecal was a French Canadian fur trapper in the early community of Champoeg. Lucille was a Salish Indian. Her mother was a woman of the Flathead Nation.[l] They lived in St. Louis, Oregon until about 1880, when they moved to Wapinitia, east of the Cascades, and to nearby Dufur in 1884, where they died and are buried. Many descendents remain. Lucille died in 1895 and Gideon died in 1896.[li] The surname for Gedeon Senecal in these records has a variety of spellings, including Senechal and Senegal. The Catholic Church and census records indicate that they had eighteen children born between 1851 and 1884. There may be some discrepancies, but based on these records the following are listed as their children.<br/>Marcellina was born 19 December 1851 in St. Louis Oregon.[lii] She died 28 October 1870 at age 19, in St. Louis, Oregon.[liii] This was shortly after the birth of her daughter Louise Eugenie on 21 October 1870, in St. Louis, Oregon. Her daughter’s baptismal sponsors were Peter Luyssier and Thais Senecal.[liv]Marcellina married Jean Baptiste Vandall 25 July 1868.[lv] Two known children.<br/>Thais was born 10 November 1853 in St. Louis, Oregon.[lvi] She married Pierre Lucier, on 9 October 1871 in St. Louis, Oregon.[lvii] Pierre was the son of Etienne Lucier and his second wife Marie Marguerite Chinouk.[lviii] Five known children.<br/>Marcel Joseph was born 7 September 1855 in St. Louis, Oregon.[lix]  He died 14 June 1933 in Suplee, Crook County, Oregon.

Eleven known children.<br/>Remy was born 9 November 1866 in St. Louis, Oregon.[lxx]<br/>Prosper was born 20 January 1867 in St. Louis, Oregon.

In 1842 he appears in the following list of extracted names of interest as related to this family.<br/>1842 Census      Male over 18       Female over 18          <br/>Children Ettiene Lucier or Lussier              1                          3                          4         Michael (Senecal) LaFrombais (e)               1                          1                          3         Andrew LaChapelle                                      1                          1                          1         F Vandall                                                   1                           1                          3<b>        J Sneckal                                            <br/>       1                            1<br/></b>       B Ducharm or Ducherme                          1                            1                          1[lxxxiii] In the 1850 Census, he is a farmer with about $3,000 in real estate in Marion County, Oregon Territory, listed as Senecal.[lxxxiv] In the Oregon State Census of 1853 he is in Marion County, listed as Senegal.[lxxxv] In the 1860 Census, he is a farmer with about $5,000 in real estate and $1,975 in personal estate, in Butteville, Northern Precinct, Marion, Oregon, listed as Snakall.[lxxxvi] In the 1870 Census, he is no longer at Butteville and no other location has been determined. In the 1880 Census, he is a farmer in Oak Grove, Wasco County, Oregon listed as Snecall.[lxxxvii] By the 1900 Census both parents are deceased, and five of the younger children are living with their brother Vital in Dufur Village, Ramsey, Wasco, Oregon.            Thus ends this portion of the family history research on the Senecal family. To round out the information on the family there are many avenues for future research. First, and foremost, it is important to verify all extracted and indexed records by locating the original Catholic Church documents of the St. Paul and St. Louis church registers, of the Archdiocese of Oregon, which are available as microfilms at the Oregon Historical Society. The Oregon State Archives, Oregon Historical Records Index, indicates there are an estate file for Gideon dated 1901, two land claims dated 2 September 1846 and 19 February 1849 both in Champoeg County, Oregon, and early Census and Tax records.[lxxxviii] An Oregon Donation Land Claim record is available at the Genealogical Forum of Oregon.[lxxxix]This article is dedicated to the descendents of the Senecal family. It provides the very basic information about a substantial early Oregon family who intermixed with the very founding of this state. Gideon Senecalle, who was married 27 February 1843 in St. Paul, was a signer of the 2 May 1843 agreement for a provincial government in Champoeg and he voted against it.[xc] While most of the French Canadians voted against the agreement, Etienne Lucier voted for it. Understanding the history of the time period will further build the history of the Senecal family.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>[i] “Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest."
