<li class="gt-list-item gt-text">BURT GORDON IJAMS, principal of the third ward school of Urbana, was born in that city, December 23, 1871, and is a son of Joseph R., and Margaret (Gordon) Ijams, the former a native of Muskingum county, Ohio, the latter of Michigan. The mother was the only child of Alexander and Catherine (Batty) Gordon, natives of London, England, and New York, respectively. They came west in 1835 and her mother died in Michigan at the age of seventy years, her father in Illinois, at the age of eighty-eight. They were members of the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches. Mrs. Gordon was a daughter of William and Sarah Batty, who were also born in New York, and from that state removed to Pennsylvania, where they made their home for twenty years, but spent their last days in Michigan. Mr. Batty was a farmer by occupation. In his family were seven children, three sons and four daughters, but only one is now living, Avaline, wife of Samuel Van Duzer. who lives near Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br/><br/>Lewis Ijams, our subject's paternal grandfather, was born in Maryland, in 1797, of Welsh descent, but spent the greater part of his early life in Ohio, where he served as quartermaster and colonel in the state militia. In 1851 he came to Illinois and became an extensive stock raiser near Bloomington. He married Eliza Rodman, who was born in Pennsylvania and was descended from old Quaker ancestry of Ireland. Both have been dead for many years. In their family were eleven children. Those living are: Joseph Rodman, father of our subject; Lewis E., who is mentioned below; George, a resident of Bloomington; Mrs. Mary Griffith, of Colorado; Charlotte, wife of Rev. J. W. Colwell, a member of the Central Illinois Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church, and Jennie, who lives with her brother, Lewis E., and Mary, who lives in Boulder, Colorado.<br/><br/>Lewis E. Ijams, uncle of our subject, was born in Muskingum county, Ohio, November 21, 1841. He was a soldier of the Civil war, enlisting first on the 10th of May, 1862, in Company F, Sixty-eighth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, for three months, and re-enlisting, April 1, 1863, in Company M, Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry. His first engagement was the battle of Jonesville against Longstreet's cavalry, where as orderly sergeant he commanded his company, repulsing a charge in a hand-to-hand encounter and meeting with heavy losses. He was severely wounded and taken prisoner with the entire command. After his recovery he was with the army sent against General Hood, and took part in the battles of Nashville, Columbia, Duck River and Franklin, having charge of his company and also the battalion a part of the time, although not a commissioned officer. A severe storm was raging during the battle of Nashville, and suffering from exposure he was obliged to go to the hospital on the second day of that engagement. He practically had command of his company for a year, and was discharged at Chicago, October 11, 1865, with the rank of captain. This company lost thirty-three men in Andersonville and other southern prisons. Captain Ijams now resides in Bloomington, and has served as county treasurer of McLean county for twelve or fifteen years.<br/><br/>About 1850, Joseph R. Ijams, father of our subject, came to Illinois and settled near Bloomington. In 1867 he came to Champaign, and is now living retired at No. 299 South Race street, Urbana. In early life he was interested in railroad business, and served as assistant superintendent of the Chicago division of the Wabash railroad for twelve years, ending about 1880. He, too, was a soldier of the Civil war, enlisting in the early part of 1861, as a private in the Ninety-fourth Illinois Volunteer Infantry. He remained in the service four years and participated in many important battles, but fortunately was never wounded nor taken prisoner. He served in the office of General McNulta while the latter was at New Orleans. He had three children: Lewis A., who died in 1871, at the age of two years; Burt G., our subject; and Harriet Catherine, who is attending school at Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>Mr. Ijams, whose name introduces this review, was educated in the Urbana high schools and the Illinois University, and in 1891 commenced teaching in the district schools of this county. He accepted a position as teacher in the public schools of Urbana in 1894, and two years later was made principal of the intermediate department. Since then he has been promoted to principal of the grammar department and is still filling that position in a most creditable and satisfactory manner, being one of the most thorough and competent teachers in the city. He is a stanch Republican in politics, and is a member of the Alpha Tau Omega, a college fraternity, and of the Presbyterian church.</li>
