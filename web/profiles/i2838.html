I have seen reference that this William was the son of Richard Iiams and his 2nd wife Elizabeth Gaither. But, the date of this William’s birth somewhere around or after 1718 does not comport with the dates of the birth of his children. He would have been nearly 58 years old before the birth ofhis first child Mary. Does anyone have more detailed information on this William Iiams and Elizabeth of Breakneck Road, East of Cumberland, MD?

It refers to:<br/><br/><br/><br/> William Iams b. 1750-1755<br/><br/><a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/ijams/messages/362.html" target="_blank">http://genforum.genealogy.com/ijams/messages/362.html</a><br/><br/>James, thanks for the update. I see that you are still actively searching the background of our William (b. 1755). Our cousin Darius Brant of Phoenixville, PA., knows the site of the old farm and tells me the old farm house still stands and is owned my a local doctor. At least that was the case the last time I spoke with Darius, some years ago. Yes, and of course the name Iiams/Ijams/Iams/Iames, has been misspelled or written incorrectly in census over the years. I feel certain that the Iiams' of Allegany County, Maryland are the same Iiams' of Bedford County, Pennsylvania. I get the feeling the Iiams clan were nomadic, and still are to this day. Tracing our William, back to the Iiams' of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, is a real challenge. I once thought Harry Newman, had a handle on it but, some of his research work has been call into question by several othe Iiams genealogist.<br/><br/>From: <KitCoach@aol.com><br/>Subject: Iiams Family Origins<br/>Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1999 11:02:02 EDT<br/><br/>Hi, Iiams researchers!<br/><br/>I'm writing in response to the posting by Michael Dorsey Iams in which he<br/>says:<br/><br/>"It seems that all Iams/Ijams/Imes in the United States descend from a<br/>William Iiams who immigrated to Anne Arundel County, Maryland around 1660.<br/>It is unclear where he came from, but it seems most likely came from<br/>Wales, possibly as a result of the English Civil War between the Oliver<br/>Cromwell led Parliment and King Charles I. The first record of him is his<br/>marriage to Elizabeth Cheyney in 1669. That marriage produced 6 children<br/>from which<br/>all of us descend."<br/><br/>Of course, the part about William Iiams' origins in Wales are highly<br/>speculative, and we ought to be careful in passing on that information (lest<br/>it become "fact") unless we always preface it as Michael did.<br/><br/>This is not the first time that I have seen it stated that ALL the Iiams<br/>(variant spellings) in the United States are descended from William Iiams and<br/>Elizabeth Cheyney. To make this assertion, you first have to know EVERY<br/>Iiams in the United States and their ancestry. The statement implies that no<br/>other member of this, or any other Iiams family ever immigrated to the U.S.<br/>and bore descendants; an assertion, I think, that nobody is qualified to make.<br/><br/>I am descended from William Iams who lived in Bedford County, PA and Allegany<br/>County, MD and died in the latter in 1831. His will in Allegany Co., MD was<br/>also copied some years later, into the Bedford County, PA Court Records,<br/>presumably for reasons of land transfer; some of the property in his will<br/>being in that county.<br/><br/>Many of his descendants, including myself and earlier generations who still<br/>live on and near the old Bedford County property have tried, in vain, to make<br/>a connection to the Anne Arundel, MD, Iiams family. We would all dearly love<br/>to find a connection to this venerable family. In my own research, I have<br/>come tantalizingly close at times, thinking I was about to solve this<br/>mystery, only in the end to fail to find necessary documentation.<br/><br/>All that aside, I have written some "alternate" theories as to the origin of<br/>my William Iams who died in 1831 in Allegany Co., PA which I will send to the<br/>newsgroup in a seperate posting. However, I think I have adequate<br/>documentation to disprove the statement that all Iiams in the U.S descend<br/>from William Iiams and Elizabeth Cheyney.<br/><br/>The earliest Iams known to have been in Bedford County, PA was one Richard<br/>Iams (occasional differing spellings). He is mentioned in some early<br/>histories of Bedford County as being one of twelve or thirteen settlers who<br/>settled in what came to be known as the "Spurgeon Settlement"; one of the<br/>first white settlements in the county. Richard's grave marker (the second<br/>oldest known in the county) read, "Jan 26th 1758, in his 72nd year". And<br/>here is the crux of my point. That means that Richard was born in 1686.<br/><br/>RICHARD IAMS OF BEDFORD COUNTY, PA 1686 - 1758:<br/><br/>is clearly not the Richard Iiams who was the son of William Iiams and<br/>Elizabeth Cheyney, the Anne Arundel, MD immigrants. Their son, Richard was<br/>born about 1673 and died in Anne Arundel County, MD in 1761.<br/><br/>William Iiams and Elizabeth Cheyney's oldest (known) child was William.<br/>Being born in 1670, this William, Jr. COULD have fathered a child named<br/>Richard when he was sixteen, but this is almost certainly not the case both<br/>because of its unliklihood and the fact that this William, Jr. had a son<br/>named Richard who was born in 1702. William, Jr.'s (married Elizabeth<br/>Plummer) first (known) child was Elizabeth, born in 1697.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that Richard Iams of Bedford County COULD NOT BE a<br/>descendant of William Iiams and Elizabeth Cheyney. He could have been old<br/>William's brother, but we have no indication of this. He could have been<br/>another relative, or he could have been unrelated. Wouldn't we like to know?<br/><br/>My relatives and I continue to seek any information leading to the discovery<br/>of the parents, spouse, and family of William Iams (prob. born before 1755)<br/>who lived in Bedford County, PA and died, with will, in Allegany County, MD,<br/>in 1831.<br/><br/>Christopher Bryce<br/>Greenville, South Carolina<br/><br/>From: <KitCoach@aol.com><br/>Subject: William Iams of Allegany Co., MD and Bedford Co., PA<br/>Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1999 11:02:10 EDT<br/><br/>Here is my theory of the origin of my ancestor, William Iams, who lived in<br/>Bedford County, PA and also Allegany County, MD where he died in 1831.<br/><br/>William lived on land in Bedford Co., PA that is known as "Spurgeon's<br/>Choice", part of the very early Spurgeon Settlement. How William Iams got<br/>Spurgeon's Choice land is not known. There is apparently no known deed of<br/>transfer.<br/><br/>Many researchers have ignored something that I am beginning to see as<br/>significant. We know that there was a Richard Iames who settled in or near<br/>Spurgeon's Choice and died there on 26 Jan 1758. He was 72 years old, which<br/>means he was born about 1686. He doesn't fit with any known Iiams of the old<br/>Eastern Maryland Iiams family about which Newman wrote so much. Of that<br/>family, he is too old to be any of the immigrant William and Elizabeth's<br/>children, nor do we have any information about the immigrant William having<br/>any brother or other relatives that came over. We simply cannot tell who he<br/>was, where he came from (although the other settlers at Spurgeon's Choice are<br/>said to have come from Virginia - and this could have been what is now West<br/>Virginia and may not have been very distant from the Maryland settlement) or<br/>if there he was any relation to the more famous Maryland family mentioned.<br/><br/>The fact is, we find our Iams family and some of its descendants down to<br/>today living right on the Spurgeon's Choice land that this old Richard lived<br/>on, and his gravestone is (or was, in recent and documented memory) still on<br/>the property. That, in itself, is a pretty strong argument for our descent<br/>from this Richard, and it has been almost completely ignored; perhaps by the<br/>desire to link up with the Eastern Maryland family and the fact that this<br/>Richard just doesn't fit in. I think we'd be further ahead if we just<br/>ignored the Anne Arundel, MD family unless our research can establish a link<br/>by working backwards in time, one step at a time. When you can't find who an<br/>ancestors parents were, the line simply ends, and there's not much you can do<br/>about it. Again, trying to establish a connection with the Eastern Maryland<br/>family has received hundreds and hundreds of hours of research by many Iams<br/>descendants including myself, and we are no closer to establishing a<br/>connection with this family that when we began, so far as I can tell.<br/><br/>My theory, then, has become that Richard is our ancestor. I'd be very<br/>willing to see this theory disproved and change my findings accordingly. But<br/>how can we ignore the historical record that he was one of the first settlers<br/>in the area, and that the Iames family has been seen to have lived on this<br/>same land for nearly three hundred years? That's not proof, but it is darn<br/>strong evidence.<br/><br/>We know nothing of this early Richard's children. The first courthouse<br/>record we have of Iamses in Bedford County is a William, who appears on the<br/>tax lists in 1783. He is listed with sons who were older than the known sons<br/>of our William, who died in Allegany Co., MD in 1831, and appears almost<br/>certainly to be a different person. He is the one I think is our William<br/>1831s father, and I conjecture, also the father of Hugh, who shows up in<br/>Bedford Co., PA's tax records. Hugh Iiams appears on the tax lists for the<br/>first time in 1789, perhaps when he reached the age of majority (and I'm not<br/>sure what that age was; 16 - 21, I imagine - 18 would be a good ballpark<br/>figure to use for now). In 1798, William Iiams, Sr. granted to Hugh Iiams a<br/>parcel of land in Spurgeon's Choice, lying on Town Creek (to begin to answer<br/>my own question). Most likely, Hugh was granted this land from his father.<br/>He could have bought, or otherwise received it from his supposed brother,<br/>William 1831, but this William was probably his younger brother, and purchase<br/>from his father seems much more likely.<br/><br/>In 1808, a William Iiams, Sr. and a William Iiams, Jr. appear together as<br/>witnesses to a will. We can't prove much by it; our William 1831 had a son,<br/>William, who would have been about 22 that year. Could be them; could be the<br/>older William d.1831 and his father. Also, in those days, "Jr." and "Sr."<br/>did not necessarily mean father and son. "Sr." was sometimes used to<br/>differentiate between two related people of the same name; not necessarily<br/>father and son.<br/><br/>We can now conjecture that William, Sr., was the father of Hugh and William<br/>d. 1831, got the land from his father, and his father may have been the early<br/>pioneer settler, Richard Iames. I am now piling conjecture upon unproven<br/>fact, but I think this is a step ahead of what we have produced before.<br/>Ulitmately, we can't prove my theory, because the early records of these<br/>things, to my knowledge, don't exist.<br/><br/>My relatives and I continue to seek any information leading to the discovery<br/>of the parents, spouse, and family of William Iams (prob. born before 1755)<br/>who lived in Bedford County, PA and died, with will, in Allegany County, MD,<br/>in 1831. Many thanks to all researchers on this problem.<br/><br/>Christopher Bryce<br/>Greenville, South Carolina
